Police and coroner immediatley ruled it a suicide while first responders said it looked more like a lynching.  There has been a large amount of discrepency between what the cops say happened and what the family say happened.  Authorities failed to conduct an autopsy - they instead embalmed it before Keith's famliy was even informed that he was dead.  Police did not conduct a full investigation because they insisted it was just a suicide. Keith was found in clothing that did not belong to him. Investigators and pathologists years later reviewed the case and found that police at the time did not follow proper procedures and that Keith did not commit suicide. They also found toxins in his blood - such as some chemicals used in cleaning fluids (the various chemicals were at toxic/lethal levels). He may have been dead/near dead before the hanging happened. Keith's friend Rodney Kendall stated that some people, including a guy Mark Finley, were looking for Keith.  Keith had some issues at the time of his death, such as losing his car (to his dad) and losing his job / being between jobs.  Police and his family have different versions of what was going on in Keith's life at the time.  Police went out of their way to silence Keith's mother and even blamed her for not keeping her son safe. The mother, Mary, tried to accept her son's death.  But later on, she was mailed crime scene photos that clearly showed something fishy was going on (Keith's clothing and shoes weren't his). The knot in the noose was very complicated, and it looked more like he had been hoisted/strangled rather than jumping from a log to hang himself.  She confronted the police again, and the police again refused to actually investigate the case. Police destroyed the crime scene shortly after Keith's death.  Clearly some cover up going on / police incompetence.  Possible suspect Mark Finley was killed in a bike accident in 1993 - the injuries he sustained suggested something more sinister happened (perhaps being hit by car), but the cops insisted it was just a bike accident.  One of the original lead cops was suspended by the police due to being arrested over violence against his girlfriend."

Suzy's family campaigned for reform and laws were enacted that caused for more registration of minicab drivers, more regulations regarding harassment and stalking, and the registration of sex offenders. 
Similar crimes (possibly connected?) occured: Shirley Banks's disappearance. Banks was murdered by John Cannan.  John Cannan is the only suspect in Suzy's disappearance. While they don't have enough evidence to directly charge Cannan with Suzy's death/disappearance, investigators are sure he is responsible.  Cannan is in prison for life over the murder of Banks.  He may have committed other murders, too (Sandra Court).  So while Suzy's case is officially unsolved, it is very likely Cannan is responsible.
As of 2018, the Suzy Lamplugh trust is campaigning to have harassment and stalking treated as different crimes (they're currently treated the same in Britain).

Earlier suspected murders include Brian and Katie Maggiore (1978) and Claude Snelling (1975). He escalated over time - from burglaries, to rapes, to murders that grew in level of violence and went from 1 female victim to couples.  The attacker was noted to be athletic, whose knowledge of the home and victim suggested he had stalked the victim for some time prior to attacking.  Police suggested a connection to the navy due to the complex diamond knots the attacker used to control the victims.  

By April 25, 2018, a tested DNA sample on Joseph James Deangelo, confirmed a match with the EAR/ONS.  He is in custody and currently awaiting trial.  Deangelo worked for a time as a police officer and had three daughters in the early 1980s.  

As of Jul 2018, it is known that Deangelo's DNA was swabbed from the handle of his car door and discarded trash and tissue. A relative of Deangelo had submitted dna to a genealogy website.  Multiple samples were gathered to confirm for sure that the DNA was Deangelo's and the DNA matched the EAR. 

As of Aug 2018, survivors and family members of victims of EAR/ONS attended court to see Deangelo themselves.  Prosecutors are also looking to review another case - a man called William Evans was found guilty of murdering a woman in 1979, but supporters are saying that his guilty plea was suspicious and there are similarities between this crime and EAR/ONS murders.  A male victim (Hayes) of EAR/ONS spoke out about his experience.  He and his girlfriend at the time were attacked by EAR/ONS.  It's possible that Deangelo also was still prowling neighborhoods up to the time he was arrested.

As of Sep 2018, Deangelo was charged with Snelling's murder. Prosecutors are finding ways to charge Deangelo with the rapes, too (since rape has a statute of limitations) by instead charging him with other things like kidnapping.  Deangelo may need to pay for his own prosecutor if he isn't eligible for one from the state. 

In Oct 2019, some further information was given regarding Dr. Rey Venter and the genelogical techniques they used to build the DNA profile of EARONS and connect him to Deangelo. This is helped lead them to GED match website

As of Nov 2018, there is another possible case that can be linked to Deangelo.  34 year old mom Patricia Newfield was bludgeoned in Nov 1978.  She lived only 6 blocks from Deangelo's brother.  There were no signs of forced entry.  Another possible connection is a murdered woman named Joan ______ in 1979.   These cases have not been established as Deangelo's, but there are some similarities and police are looking into it.  

As of Nov 2018, a pre-trial hearing was set for December 6.  

As of Dec 2018, the judge determined that Deangelo cannot afford his own attorney given that the trial is expected to cost around 20 million dollars.  The trial could take as long as 10 years due to the complexity of the case.  The judge does not see the need to put a media ban on the trial.

Eyre and Tynan weren't specially targeted, they just happened to be the first on scene.

A gang the police named The Flemington Crew had robbed at least four banks around Melbourne, and one of the guns used in those robberies was connected to the ambush/murders of Eure and Tynan.
Members of the Pettingill crime family were believed to be involved, and the attacks were believed to be a form of revenge against police by criminals.  Specifically, the day before the ambush, Pettingil crime family member Victor Pierce's best friend Graeme Jensen was fatally shot by police during a robbery. This was just the last in several years of back and forth between police and the criminal underworld associated with Victor Pierce.
At the trial of the four men, prosecution alleged that 6 men were involved in the planning (the four, Jedd houghton (already dead), and Jason Ryan (who turned as a witness for the cops and later entered witness protection).  Victor Pierce's wife was his alibi, but she later retracted her statement that he was with her the whole night of the murders.  She was set to be a witness for the prosecution, but she later retracted her retraction and was a hostile witness during the pre-trial and didn't attend the actual trial.

They went together, though Amy had misgivings about the trip.  On March 24, early in the morning, Amy had been drinking and dancing at the ship's club.  She was there at least by 1 am if not later.  Ron saw Amy asleep in their cab between 5:15 and 5:30 am, but when he got up at 6:00 am, she was no longer there.  She was not seen again. 
Extensive searches of the ship and surrounding seas produced no sign of her whereabouts. Amy was a trained lifeguard and investigators said there was no evidence that she had fallen overboard or committed suicide.
Since that time, there have been some reported sightings of Amy in Curacao in 1998 and 1999. This second sighting, the witness claimed that Amy said she needed help since she was not allowed to leave. In 2005, an image of a woman resembling Amy was emailed to her parents, which suggested Amy may have been sold into sex slavery. At one point, the family hired a private investigator to look further into the case, but he ultimately was stringing the family along to get their money.

The two leading theories are that she was sold into sex slavery (the family alleges a ship worker called ""yellow"" may have drugged her at the bar and then abducted her) or that she fell overboard (since she was likely still intoxicated and sleeping by the balcony, she may have fallen over the railing. Alternatively, she could have had a conflict with Yellow, which ended with her being pushed overboard). 

Either way, she is likely not alive today.

This crime took place on the MS Rhapsody of the Sea - en route to Curacao"

He was an extremely charismatic speaker, like many cult leaders are. His church, the Peoples Temple, was formed in Indiana in 1955. His following quickly took the form of a cult, since it brought in much money, the members were required to dedicate all their time and money to the cause, and they were expected to follow their leader wherever he went.  Jones because extremely paranoid as time went on and came to believe the US government was trying to catch him/persecute him.  He eventually decided to leave the country after investigations into the legality of his organization intensified in San Francisco. He set up Jonestown in Guyana and insisted his followers join him there. It was set up as a communist community - since Jones was interested in communism and even wished to move them all to Russia.  Life in jonestown was poor.  The living conditions were terrible, despite Jones holding it up as a paradise community. Members worked 12 hour days, 6 days a week trying to maintain Jonestown.  In evenings, members were expected to sit and listen to lectures on socialism and other ideas Jones liked.  During these evenings, Jones would interrogate individual followers and solidify his hold on the community, nearly like brainwashing. Jones set himself up as the father of these hundreds of temple members and insisted he was called father.  Jones continued to fall more and more into paranoia, becoming obsessed with communism and the belief that the American government was out to get him. People who attempted to escape Jonestown were caught and punished, even drugged and tortured. Jones began to have ""white night rehearsals,"" which were addresses to the temple members regarding their safety and essentially served to spread Jone's paranoia about the CIA to members.  He kept saying the capitalist pigs were out to destroy Jonestown. He insisted the only way to live genuinely free was to either flee to the soviet union, or commit ""revolutionary suicide"", or attempt to fight the invading CIA attackers. On a few occassions, a simulated ""revoutionary suicide"" was rehearsed.  Paranoia was at an all time high.

Congressman Leo Ryan of California visited Jonestown to investigate rumors of murder and abuse happening there.  On Nov 14, he flew there with a delegation to visit Jones. He was at first not allowed to access Jonestown.  By Nov 17, Ryan and his delegation was allowed in to visit.  While he was there, some temple members tried to plead for help and defect by handing him a note asking for help to escape.  Ryan and his delegation stayed there over night and the next day, Ryan and his delegation left for Port Kaituma airstrip to leave. Some defectors tried to join him, including Jones loyalist Larry Layton and other loyalists.  At the airstrip, Ryan and his people were attacked by the loyalists, ending in the death of 5 people, Ryan included.

""The attacks on Ryan (likely ordered by Jones) were used by Jones to start enacting a final """"white night"""". With the death of a government official, Jones said the time to act was now. The soviets wouldn't have them, and the only other option available was revolutionary suicide. Loyalists poisoned koolaid. Jones recorded this white night on """"Death Tape,"""" where he was convincing his members to take the poison. A temple member, Christine Miller, argued against taking the poison and argued that they should find another way, but she was silenced by other temple members. Taking the poison was not entirely voluntary, given that loyalists stood around with guns and members were called forward to take their poison. They started with babies and children. Death occurred within 5 minutes, and people who took the poison later could hear the first people dying in agony. Then the remaining began to panic and showed a """"reluctance to die."""" Later that evening, 4 people - Sharon Amos and her 3 kids - at temple headquarters in Georgetown also committed murder-suicide via a kitchen knife. 

All in all, 918 people died as a result of Jonestown. 
Only 33 people who were in Jonestown that morning survived the night: 
11 people escaped into the jungle and watched 30 miles to another town. 
14 defectors survived the airport ambush. 
4 people were sent away by Jones or his mistress. 
4 lived through the mass suicides by hiding 

The demographics of Jones's followers were overwhelmingly black and female (black people made up 70% of jonestown, and black women in particular made up 45%). White women made up 13% and white men made up 11%. Roughly a third of the 918 dead were minors (304). 

Jonestown was the largest loss of American civilian lives in a deliberate act until 9/11. November 18, 2018 was the 40th anniversary of Jonestown.""

Robert and Kathy became the legal guardians of Brenda (he had offered to adopt her within hours of the murders) and they also took over the newsagency that the Lin family had run. In May 2010, police were able to match bloody footprints at the crime scene with shoes belonging to Robert. After a covert operation, they obtained surveillance of Robert trying to dispose of the evidence. Bloodstains in Robert's home matched blood from 4 of the 5 victims. Robert was then arrested in May 2011, and in 2017, Brenda revealed publicly that during the time she was under his guardianship, he began molesting her. His desire for his niece was argued by prosecutors as a motive for the crime. He had began touching her inappropriately even before the murders occurred.

Witnesses saw Pesce with a man who is believed to be the strangler, and he was described as caucasian or mixed race with a light colored van.
An informant, an unidentified 43 year old caucasian man, came forward to police saying a psychic told him the location of Pesce's body, but the location was wrong.  This informant was arrested on May 9th, when Pesce's body was found. Those who knew this man personally said he was ""caucasian, middle aged, clean cut, receding hairline, black glasses, polite"", but seemed to make people uncomfortable by being too interested in some women. His ex wife and girlfriend both also claimed that they engaged in sexual bondage, and allegedly on the same nights of the murders, he would leave the house. This suspect lived in Ewa beach and worked as a mechanic.  He failed a polygraph test and was interrogated, but was released due to a lack of concrete evidence.
Two months later, a woman came forward claiming she saw Pesce with a man the night she died and she successfully chose the suspect out of a photo lineup.  Police believed the man was their killer, but only had circumstantial evidence and thus he was never charged.  This suspect was Howard Gay, as reported by some media outlets later on.

Most people believe Gay is the perpetrator, but police bungled the case and he was let go.  It seems that he died in 2012 and cannot be charged now anyway. Thus it is officially unsolved but we likely know the perpetrator."

Since the escape attempt failed, the ringleaders Coy, Cretzer, and Hubbard decided to just stay alive as long as possible, so the escape became a siege that didn't end until two days later.  Cretzer shot into the cells where they had imprisoned guards, wounding most of them.

Allen enlisted the help of the Anglin brothers, who wanted to escape as much as he did, as well as Frank Morris, a high-IQ criminal with a long history of prison escapes. They spent months carving holes out of their prison cells (they found the old concrete was crumbly), creating dummies that would serve to mislead the prison guards, opening the vent that would lead outside, and creating life vests.  On the night of the escape, Morris and the Anglin brothers were able to get out, but West was not able to since the hole in his cell was blocked by a pipe in the wall.  He was left behind, even though he spent several hours widening the hole and he eventually got through. By then, the other three men were gone and West couldn't slip past the guards outside. The next day, guards realized they were 3 men short and West claimed to have masterminded the plan (though it is more likely that Morris was the real mastermind). 
The three men have never been seen again.  It is likely that they drowned in the currents surrounding Alcatraz island, but their bodies have not been found and some people think they managed to make it to land and live out the rest of their lives.  The FBI has concluded that while it is theoretically possible that they reached Angel island 2 miles away from Alcatraz, the frigid water and strong currents made it unlikely they survived.  But at the same time, no bodies have ever been found, and given the currents of the bay, the bodies probably would have washed ashore or somewhere they could've been found.

In August 2018, a tv show attested that the Anglin brothers may have survived and lived out their lives.  A photo surfaced that some facial experts say is of the Anglin brothers.

In November 2018, the FBI recreated the fake heads the escapees had made.  They made replicas for historical purposes.  They will be displayed and available for viewing.

She was selected as a finalist and went roughly 2 hours from her home in  Marseille to meet up with Nicole de Forestier's (sp) assistant Le Quest (sp), the agent in charge of the ad.  She never returned.  
Dominic Terasco was a bar owner and a police informant.  He contacted Aigues-Mortes police to report a conversation he had overheard where a ""friend"" talked about kidnapping/harming a woman.  Terasco reported this but would not give the ""Friend's"" name due to fear of the man, so he instead gave a discription of his car and the location the man would go to harm this woman.  
Police could not find a woman or man matching this description, and Terasco realized too late he'd accidentally given a description of the wrong car. 
On May 4, Silvan reported Elodie missing, but Marseille police didn't take him seriously and didn't immediately file the missing persons report.  When the report was finally sent out to various police departments, the cops at Aiges-Mortes immediately noticed the similarities between it and Terasco's call.  Terasco was interviewed again, and he said he saw this ""Friend"" and a woman who appeared unconscious in the ""friend's"" car driving passed a police roadblock.  He told those police to arrest the ""friend"", but they didn't take him seriously.  Aiges-Mortes police confirmed this happen with those police at the roadblock.  
Now the police insisted Terasco must give them the name of this friend, and he admitted to it finally - Guillaume Mangot, a middle aged man with a long history of violent crimes against women spanning back to the 1980s.  With a sting operation involving Terasco, police lured Mangot to the bar where they sprung on him.  Mangot was there with another friend, Richard Linier.  Police found that Mangot had Elodie's credit card.  They further went to Linier's home and found that Linier's daughter had Elodie's cell phone. Interviews between Mangot, Linier, and Linier's wife and daughter eventaully revealed that Mangot showed up at Linier's home with a drugged woman.  They stored her in the basement, and Linier made references to assaulting/suffocating her.  He gave Elodie's belongings to the Liniers as a gift.  The Liniers claim they did not report this due to fear of Mangot.  Mangot claimed his only crime was stealing Elodie's credit card, and it was Elodie's own fault because any one should have seen the ad was a scam.  
Mangot was given a relatively light sentence and even appealed to have his maximum sentence  lowered to 30 years, with a minimum of 20.  
Terasco admits now that his intial refusal to name Mangot was a mistake that may have cost Elodie her life."

She had been dragged from where she was cleaning down two flights of stairs, possibly while still alive. A Sydney detective sergeant said it was one of the most brutal, vicious slayings in the history of the state. Her injuries included torn skin, bruising, disembowlement, disfigurement, cigarette burns, torn hair. She clearly put up a strong fight but lost.  The butcher was investigated but found to not have been involved.
A month after Kruger's death, Anna Dowlingkoa (a prostitute) was found stabbed and mutilated in bush at Menai.  Detectives believed the two women were killed in the same week by the same person.
Some investigators believe there may possibly be a link between the murder of Kruger and the Wanda Beach girls, but there is no actual evidence to link the two. They do note the similarities of the crimes - the body was dragged along the ground, there was no attempt to conceal the bodies, and sexual molestation after the slayings occurred in each case, and the victims were killed in or near Sydney.

Case evidence: There is no apparent motive and the case has not been solved. Based off the crime, it appeared that the killer was familiar with the layout of the Piccadilly center and Kruger's schedule - he knew she would be working alone at that time.  His bloody footprint and cigarettes were found near the body. The murder weapon was a large double edged knife. Blonde hair was found attached to Kruger's body (her hair was grey/dyed reddish brown), presumably the killer's. She died of strangulation and the stabbings/mutilation occurred after death. "

When he started getting really paranoid, Ulbricht hired hitmen to take out the men who he felt would betray him - what he didn't know is that the deaths were faked and just tools to make him sloppy. 

As of Jul 2018, Variety Jones / Roger Clark (right hand man of Ulbricht) has been in a Thai prison for the last 2.5 years, avoiding extradiction to the US.  In July, he lost his fight and he will be in the US to face trial for his part in the Silk Road.  Gary Davis also lost his appeals.  Ulbricht argued that his convictions were unreasonable, but the supreme court denied his appeal.

As of August 2018, some supporters of Ulbricht hope that Trump will pardon Ulbricht. 

In September 2018, a petition to the white house to reduce Ulbricht's sentence was gaining steam. 

As of Nov 2018, an admin, Gary Davis, of the Silk Road going by ""Libertas"" who resolved disputes between buyers and drug dealers has pleaded guilty to narcotics conspiracy.  Sentencing is not until Jan 2019. Ross Ulbricht is currently in solitary for his ""own safety.""  He is trying to plant an apple tree in his solitary cell from the apples he gets every day.

As of Nov 2018, authorities have tracked down ""red and white"" James Ellington in Canada.  He is the suspected hitman that Ulbricht hired.   A petition asking for Trump to grant clemency to Ulbricht has gotten a hundred thousands signatures.  The white house will likely not give a response to the petition, but we'll see.  

As of Dec 2018, Ulbricht has been reaching out to people in the bitcoin community for support in his case.  He thinks his best hope is to get clemency from the president.  "

They did the same with Alexander's fear of blood by torturing animals and normalizing blood.

He worked as a Departments of Parks employee in New Mexico, which allowed him some space and isolation to conduct his fantasies.  He built a sound proof torture chamber (""Toy Box"") that contained many torture devices that he used as sex toys, including whips, chains, pulleys, straps, clamps, spreader bars, blades, and saws.  The torture chamber also contained information on methods or techniques to inflict pain. His victims were also subjected to sexual abuse by Ray's circle of sadomasochistic friends and even his dogs.  He would keep the women docile and confused via fear and a drug concoction which he believed would wipe their memories of the event.  This drug concotion seemed somewhat successful, since the known surviving victims have somewhat (and various levels of) hazy memories of the events.  He would kidnap women for several days at a time to keep in his chamber.  He had a pre-recorded message for them, informing them what was about to happen to them.  It is unknown exactly how many victims Ray had since he did release several of his victims (implying he must have been confident in his memory-altering drug concoction).  His spree continued on for an unknown number of years and an unknown number of victims until one victim managed to escape. (Some suspect that bodies have not been discovered because they were dumped down abandoned mines on the East side of Caballo Lake).

Known victims: 
Cynthia Vigil was kidnapped by Ray after he impersonated an undercover officer who was arresting her for solicitation.  She was held captive in his home for three days until March 22, 1999, while Ray was at work.  She managed to get the keys that locked her chains, attack Hendy (who was supposed to be keeping guard over her), and run away from the property completely naked except for a slave collar and some chains still attached to her.  She ran to a nearby home to seek help and call police.  This is what started the investigation into Ray, who up until that point was known in his community and workplace as a nice person.  

Angelica Montano, an earlier victim of Ray's, came forward with her story once Vigil's story was in the news.  She had a similar case of kidnapping and torture, but she had been released by Ray.  Montano had been kidnapped at Raymound's Lounge in Truth or Consequences (the manager of this Lounge was an accomplice).  She said she had reported the incident to the police after it happened, but there was no follow up.

Kelli Garrett had been kidnapped by Ray in 1996.  She was a newlywed who'd gotten into a fight with her husband, and went off with friends to let off steam. She was tortured for a couple of days before Ray slashed her throat and dumped her on the side of the road.  She survived and stumbled home, where her husband accused her of cheating after she couldn't remember the events from the past several days.  After the Ray case was blown up in the media, Garrett's former mother in law recognized that Garrett may have been a victim and called it in to police.  She was right; Garrett had a matching tattoo that was seen in one of Ray's videos of torture sessions.

Marie Parker was an ex girlfriend of Dennis Roy Yancy.  Yancy, Jesse Ray (Ray's daughter), and Ray all participated in Marie Parker's kidnapping, torture, and strangulation. 

""Perpetrators:
Dennis Roy Yancy, sadomasochistic friend of Ray's. Participated in and committed the murder of Marie Parker, an ex girlfriend. He was convicted of second degree murder and conspiracy to commit first degree murder. He received two 15 year terms. 

Jesse Ray, Ray's daughter who assisted in the kidnapping of Marie Parker. She tried on charges of kidnapping and sentenced to 2.5 years in prison and 5 years probation. 

Cindy Hendy was Ray's girlfriend and likely accomplice in several of the kidnappings and tortures. She testified against Ray for a more lenient sentence. She receieved 36 years in prison. 

Ray was the primary perpetrator in all these crimes. It is unknown how far back his crimes go and how many victims he has, but the collection of victim items in his possession implied that he had many victims. Ray was tried seperately for Vigil, Montano, and Garrett. The first trial resulted in a mistrial, and the retrial resulted in convictions on all 12 counts for which he was accused. Montano passed away before her trial could begin, so it was not conducted. Ray agreed to a plea bargain and was sentenced to 224 years in prison. Unfortunately, he would not serve most of his sentenced, since he died of a heart attack in 2002. 

It is very likely that Ray had many more accomplices and victims than is currently known. 

The FBI is still trying to identify possible victims of Ray by displaying his victim's stolen items on the FBI website. You can view the items here: https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/albuquerque/items-david-parker-ray"""

She had found some moderate success in modelling in NY and Japan, but not enough to sustain her or ""break into"" the industry.  She turned to acting as another career option. She was strong willed and persistent,  and so she accepted the many rejections from auditions with determination.  She got her biggest break when she was cast as the sister of the lead character in the prime time TV show ""My Sister Sam.""  The show ran for roughly a season and a half until it was cancelled due to falling ratings, despite that it started off with high ratings.  She threw herself into more auditions and had some minor tv and movie roles.  In 1989, she had her biggest audition yet for the role of Maria in ""The Godfather Part 3"".  While prepping for this role, a man she previously had not personally known and had no interactions with besides generic responses to fan mail, visited her at her home and shot her fatally.  She died within a half an hour of being shot.  

Robert Bardo was an obsessive fan from Arizona.  Her first noticed Rebecca when she was on ""My Sister Sam"" and became obsessed with her percocious persona of Patti.  He wrote her many fan letters and became convinced that they had a relationship and she may be in love with him like he was with her.  For roughly three years, he obsessed over everything she did.  He tried to visit her at her studio, but was rebuffed.  He hired an Arizona private investigator to obtain Rebecca's home address so he could personally visit her.  His ""relationship"" with Rebecca had become more complex, since she had acted in more adult roles that showed she wasn't her character in ""My Sister Sam"".  He resented that she may be turning into, essentially, a slutty Hollywood star (despite her roles still being relatively tame).  While Rebecca was prepping for her Godfather audition, he visited her home twice. She reacted gracefully and thanked him for the flattery, but requested that he not visit her home again.  He left, but returned again later with a gun that his brother had unlawfully bought for him (since Robert was underage).  He shot Rebecca once and left.  Robert's sister reported him to the police, and he was later arrested while making a scene in traffic.  Robert's lawyers argued he was mentally ill and should only be convicted of 2nd degree murder (not pre-meditated), which has significantly less jail time.  Instead, he was found guity of first degree murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.

Rebecca's parents campaigned for gun control and changes to privacy laws.

He became well known as an expert in his field.  Through the 1980s and early 1990s, LA was dealing with a series of fires found to be purposefully set and, due to the similarities of the crimes, probably set by the same person.  One of these fires led to the deaths of four victims in Ole's Home Center store in 1984: Ada, her grandson Matthew, Carolyn, and employee Jimmy.   This particular fire was declared to be the result of an electrical fire, but Orr argued that it was actually arson.  In 1987, a convention for arson investigators was held in Fresno, and several fires were set nearby during the convention.  Another convention in 1989 in Pacific Grove had similar suspicious fires set during the convention.  This led investigator Captain Marvin G Casey of the Bakersfield fire department to suspect that the perpetrator was an attendee of these conferences.  Cross referencing the attendance lists of both conferences showed a list of 10 people that attended both.  Orr was on this list, but he and all others on the list were cleared of suspicion when their fingerprints were compared with the fingerprints Casey had found at one of the arson scenes and they didn't match.  
In late 1990 and early 1991, the Pillow Pyro task force was formed (thus named for some of the fires which were originally set in pillows) in LA, with Tom Campuzanno as a member of this force.  Eventually this force and Casey's investigation found out about each other's investigations into the fires and decided to combine their efforts.  As a result, Campuzanno and two other task force members met with Casey. They obtained a fingerprint from Casey which they were able to match to John Orr in April of 1991 due to improved fingerprint tech.  Orr was put under surveillance for several months to build a case against him and he was arrested on Dec 4, 1991.   On July 31, 1992, Orr was convicted of three coutns of arson and sentenced to three consecutive terms of 10 years in prison.   On March 24, 1993, he was convicted of three additional counts of arson pursuant to a plea bargain agreement.  On June 25, 1998, Orr was convicted of four counts of first degree murder for the 1984 fire and he was thus sentenced to life plus 20 years in prison without the possibility of parole.  
Before his arrest, Orr was working on a novel - Point of Origin - about a fire investigator who sets fires to get sexual gratification.  The book bears remarkable similarities to real acts of arson that were likely committed by Orr.   Some arson investigators and FBI criminal profilers have deemed Orr to be the worst American serial arsonists of the 20th century.  Agent Mike Matassa believes Orr set nearly 2000 fires between 1984 and 1991.  Arson investigators state that after Orr's arrest, the number of brush fires in the nearby area decreased by over 90%.   Orr maintains his innocence to this day."

Her parents divorced when she was a small child and her father, Darren, soon got together with Anjie Galsworthy.  Becky became very close with her stepmother Anjie, but had a somewhat contentious relationship with her step brother Nathan, who often didn't understand her mental health issues and felt she was using her anxiety, depression, and status as a bullying victim to get attention from people, especially from his mother Anjie.  As Becky got older, her relationship with Nathan became even worse.  
After Becky disappeared on 19 of February, she was initially believed to possibly have been a runaway.  Police and Becky's parents and grandmother made public appeals for her to come home.  Many searches for Becky was executed, but to no avail.  All of Becky's family members were helpful and open with the police regarding the search and events of the day she disappeared, except Nathan and Shauna.  Police started looking more into Nathan and Shauna and found that while their stories matched up perfectly, something seemed off.  They went to the home the two shared with their child and found it to be extremely messy and filled with hoarded junk everywhere except the bathroom, which had been recently cleaned.  After police found some evidence of blood in the house and confronted Nathan about it, he openly admitted to being involved.   Nathan and Shauna were arrested on suspicion of murder on February 28 and Becky's dismembered body was found on March 4 in a shed owned by friends of Nathan and Shauna.  As police dug further into the personal lives of Nathan and Shauna, they learned of Nathan's disdain for Becky and also that he and Shauna had a sexual interest in underage, petite girls.  Several text exchanges indicated that Nathan would like for Shauna to kidnap a girl fitting this description for him to use as he wished.  Furthermore, after Becky's disappearance, Nathan was found to have made several suspicious purchases, such as a circular power saw, gloves, face mask, goggles, and drain cleaner.  Becky had been suffocated, stabbed, dismembered and her body parts were thrown into plastic containers and suitcases and stored in a friend's garden shed.  At the trial, prosecutors argued that the motive for the killing was sexual in nature.
After the trial (which began on 6 October), Nathan was found guilty of murder and Shauna guilty of manslaughter.  Both were also convicted of kidnapping, perverting the course of justice, preventing the lawful burial of a body, and possession of two stun guns. Nathan was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 33 years and Hoare to 17 years.  Nathan's friends who own the garden shed - Karl and Jaydene - were also convicted of assisting an offender. Karl receieved 2 years imprisonment and Jaydene received 16 months.  "
100,The Beaumont Children ,11/17/2018,1:57:48,"Elsha McGill,  Milly Raso","Elsha McGill,  Milly Raso",4.38,574,Unsolved,1/26/1966,Australia,South Australia,Adelaide,3,"Jane Nartare Beaumont, Arnna Kathleen Beaumont, Grant Ellis Beaumont","9,7,4","F, F, M",Unknown,Unknown,M,"Kidnapping, murder",Unknown,,"Jim and Nancy Beaumont lived in Somerton Park, a suburb of Adelaide near Glenelg Beach.  They had three children: Jane, Arnna, and Grant.  On January 26, 1966 (Australia Day), the kids took the bus to visit the beach. They had been given money for food.  Jane was a nurting and responsible girl for her age, so her parents felt the younger kids were safe under Jane's care.  The children had taken similar trips alone (including the previous day) without incident, so there was no reason to believe January 26th would be any different. The children were expected back between 12:00 and 2:00 pm (depending on which bus-time they decided to take).  Nancy became worried when they didn't return by 2:00, and by 3:00 Jim went to the beach to look for the kids.  With no sign of them at the beach, Jim searched their neighborhood.  By 5:00, Jim and Nancy reported their missing children to the Glenelg police department.  
Initially police thought the kids just lost track of time, but when not a single trace of the kids - none of their various items they had with them that day - showed up, they became more concerned that the kids had been taken. Several witnesses at the beach that day helped to establish a timeline:  

The kids caught the 8:45 bus to the beach.
Several witnesses said they saw the kids playing with a tall, blonde, and tanned man in his mid 30s to mid 40s in Colley Reserve.  At roughly 12:15, he and the children were seen walking together away from the beach.
When the children ate lunch, they bought the food with a 1 pound note, which did not match the money their parents had given them for lunch (furthering police suspicions that there was an adult interacting with the kids).
At about 3:00, the children were seen (by their postman) walking alone away from the beach, in the direction of their home.  This was the last known sighting of the kids. (the 3:00 time has been disputed, since the postman couldn't exactly remember the tim. He later told police he believed he actually saw the kids in the morning, not the afternoon.)

Since that time, there have been various reports of sightings of the kids, but none have been confirmed as true. No further evidence of any kind has been directly linked to the Beaumont children.

Witnesses on the beach reported some odd behavior from the man seen with the children.  The kids seemed very at-ease with the man, despite the three (especially Jane) being known as shy.  At one point during the day, the man proclaimed that their money had been stolen from their possessions, alerting neighboring beach-goers to the situation.  Later on, when the kids bought lunch, they bought more than just the three of them could eat (and more than they could afford) and the shop worker noted that they had ordered a meat pie for ""the man"".  When the kids were getting ready to leave the beach, the man personally helped put on Jane and Arnna's clothing, even though Jane was old enough to take care of her own clothes and would generally be considered too shy to let a stranger so close to her.  In the weeks preceding the Australia day beach trip, the Arnna had joked about Jane having a boyfriend at the beach.  

Combining all these witness statements, and the police came to believe that this man had met the children before at the beach. He had perhaps been grooming them and getting them to trust him, which would explain why they were so at ease with him. Police theorized the man may have offered to give the kids a ride home, and that way the kids would leave the beach quietly and willingly, without making a scene. One witness led police to believe the children may have been thrown into the marina - and the entire marina was drained, but to no avail. As weeks and months passed, Jim and Nancy were inundated with calls and reports from mostly unhelpful sources like psychics. They took every possible clue they could to search for their kids. 

""Two years after the disappearance, a couple of hoax letters were sent to Jim and Nancy, written as though they were from Jane (who had often wrote letters to her parents). The letters made reference to a man who was keeping them captive and suggested that they may be let go if certain conditions were met. A third letter informed them that the children would not be let go because the man suspected the meet up was a set up. In 1992, forenxic examinations showed the letters to be hoaxes - the letters were sent by a now-41 year old man who had sent them as a prank when he was a teen. 

There have been a series of suspects over the years, but none have been definitively found to be the culprit. Some theories/investigative paths include: 
- an extreme religious sect took the children and possibly killed them in New Zealand. 
- Dutch psychic Gerard Croiset inserted himself into the investigation and, in a huge surge of media attention, he claimed he was incredibly close to discovering the bodies of the children. He claimed a warehouse near the Beaumont home was where the bodies were buried, and intense public pressure called for the building to be demolished so a full scale dig could be completed. Croiset's suspicions were wrong and he failed in his search. 
- Some suspect the Beaumont Children's disappearance may have been connected to the Family Murders (killer Bevan Spencer von Einem) Von Einem is somewhat unlikely since he was only 20 at the time of the abduction, much younger than the man witnesses saw. The children also did fit his usual victim profile. 
- James Ryan O'Neill was briefly viewed as a suspect, but there is nothing to connect him to this case. He is a suspect in other child murders, however. - Arthur Stanley Brown bore a strong resemblance to the image of the man suspected to take the children. He was responsible for the deaths of two other children in Queensland, but due to his age and deteriorating mental state (alzheimers), he wasn't pursued further as a suspect. He died in 2002. 
- Alan Anthony Munro: he became a suspect due to his children reporting that he had something to do with the case. Munro claimed he knew a man in 1966 that had been involved in the case, which had included the children's bodies being stored in the boot of the car. Police found that Munro was not involved. 
- Harry Phipps was identified as a suspect in 2015 after a woman came forward claiming her former father in law had been invovled. Her spouse had been abused by his father, Harry, as a kid, and they also lived very close to Glenelg Beach in 1966. Harry's son claimed that, in 1966, his father had said """"they're buried in the pit"""". The son believed this meant that the bodies were buried somewhere in Phipp's factory. In fact, two brothers, who had been teens in the 60s, came forward to say they'd been paid by Phipps to dig a large hole in the factory in 1966. investigations into the factory were done, but since the building has been changed so much since 1966, nothing but animal bones were found. 

Jim and Nancy divorced and live out of the spotlight. As of 2018, they are 92 and 90 years old and may never find out what happened to their children. 

As of Dec 2018, there is a growing movement to set up a monument for the Beaumont children."""

All three managed to escape to make the reports.  One of the three reports also mentioned that the man was accompanied by an older woman.  The three reported the license plate of the car, but when police traced this number, it was not connected to a white holden sedan in Queensland.

A few weeks later, 12 year old school girl Sian Kingi was bicycling home after spending time with her mother at the shops, picking out fabric for a skirt she was going to make.  She should have arrived home quickly, but there was no sight of her.  After calling all her friends, who had not seen Sian since school let out, her parents retraced the path she would have taken from the shops to their home.  They found her yellow bicycle abandoned along the path.  

Police quickly put Sian's disappearance in the newspaper asking for tips, and witness reports came in. Witnesses in the area of Pinnaroo park near the bike path reported seeing a dusty white holden sedan and a male driver and its license plate. Police tracked cars of this description, but it was an extremely common car and color.  Without any success in Queensland, the search was expanded to neighboring states. 

Roughly a week after Sian's disappearance, her body was found in the bush in Tinberrwah forest, about 12 km away from where she'd been taken.  She had been sexually assaulted, stabbed, and strangled.  

A connection was made between the three reports made in Brisbane to the kidnapping of Sian.  After expanding the search for the white holden sedan, police found it was registered in the name of Valmae Beck and the address given was the residence of her father in law.  Looking further into Beck revealed that she was married to Barry Watts and both of them had a long criminal history.  They both were on the run from various crimes.  Police managed to track them to the residence they had in Lowood, but they had already fled. Police then tracked them to The Entrance, New South Wales.  They were arrested there.  

It didn't take long for Beck to confess to the crimes, and then both Beck and Watts started accusing each other of being the primary instigator in the abduction, rape, and murder.  Beck claimed that Watts pushed her to do this because he wanted to be sexually gratified and he would leave her if she didn't, and she was too insecure to let Watts leave her.  Watts claimed that Beck was just as interested in committing the murder.   Beck was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non parole period of 14 years while Watts was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.  Neither seemed to express any regret for what they did, and police believe that they were involved in more than just that one murder."

She had planned a large trip through several European countries to last from June - October 2008.  In July, she met up with her parents in Paris to spend some time with them, and then she continued on through several countries including Austria and Croatia.  She met several new backpacker friends along the way, and in the early morning hours of September 18, 2008, they all went out to a local haunt for backpackers in Dubrovnik - Club Fuego. The following day, her backpacker friends at their hostel realized she had not returned.  After several days of her not showing up, they reported it to the hostel owners, the local police, and the Australian embassy in Croatia.  Right from the start, Dubrovnik police did not take the case seriously and they assumed Britt was just a party girl who would stumble home at some point.  Britt's parents were not informed of her disappearance for five days.   According to her parents, the Dubrovnik police were dismissive of their concerns and not actively investigating the case.  Even Australian officials asked Britt's parents to keep their interactions with the Dubrovnik police polite so as to not upset the relationship between the countries. Britt's parents refused this, of course, and the Dubrovnik police incompetence became a large point of contention between the two countries.  Three weeks after Britt disappeared, a largely decomposed body was found by fishermen in Boninovo Bay.  The advanced state of decomposition and large amount of missing body parts (including legs and some organs, like lungs), initially led officials to state it couldn't be Britt's body.  But DNA analysis proved it to be her.   Though the Dubrovnik police chief and a large chunk of staff were fired over how this case was handled and new, more competent police were hired, the case has not advanced much since then.

Some theories include:

Misadventure: a drunk Britt got separated from her friends while out parting and she fell into the sea and drowned. The damage to her body was largely done by it being dragged around the ocean. (some of the damage was confirmed by coroners to be possibly done by damage from ocean currents).  Britt's parents refute this as she wasn't really a party girl and she was much more cautious and conservative as a well-travelled person.  

Foul Play: many cameras in Club Fuego weren't properly working on the night Britt disappeared, but a camera down the street caught site of a blue van picking up someone from the club around 4:30 am.  It is possible this was Britt.  Later investigation found that in the weeks surrounding Britt's disappearance, some men in a blue van had attempted various kidnappings of foreign women in and around the club. In one such case, the men had posed as police officers to coerce the women to come with them.  It is possible that Britt fell victim to this.  

No further information on Britt's case has come to light."

As time went on, Sef's behavior seemed more suspicious - he seemed to not care his family died and he quickly was trying to access the family's funds, a 1.5 million dollar inheritance that now all went to solely him.  He gave some information to the police that didn't add up - such as the weather on the day and time of the murders, claiming to witness a man running from the house, the nature of the wounds on the bodies, his whereabouts before and during the time of the murders.  Police looked more into Sef and his story completely fell apart.  It was found that he had been faking his school grades (he was failing all 4 of his classes), he had made a ""fan made"" website in adoration of himself and his music, he was stealing money from familiy and friends and spending time and money in brothels.  As his story fell apart, Sef tried to buy and harass both a taxi driver and a prostitute into claiming to be his new alibi for the murders, but it didn't work.

16 year old Mark got involved in a message board for locals in Manchester.  He became involved with a couple young girls on the board and also befriended 14 year old John, Rachel's step brother.  He became the target of Kevin, a stalker on the board, who first blackmailed Mark into mastubating on camera and then ended up kidnapping and killing Mark's first girlfriend, Rachel.  Several other friends of Mark's were killed shortly after, leaving only Mark and John.   An older woman (Janet Dobinson) joined the board and recruited Mark to MI6. She gave him a mission first to protect John, who had the passcode to a large British fortune.  But later the order changed - Mark was told to kill John in an act of mercy killing, since John had a fatal brain tumor.  Mark was also enticed with the promise of a sexual encounter with Janet upon completion of the killing.  Mark stabbed John in an alleyway in Altrincham town centre, however John did not die.  He was in hospital for a week before being released.  

Mark was charged with attempted murder.  After he was first arrested, Mark was hesitant to reveal to police that he was an MI6 agent, but he finally revealed it to them and seemed genuinely convinced of his work.  Investigators dug into the 193 email addresses that Mark had been in contact with and found that all five people (besides Mark) involved in this case were actually John. 

John admitted everything after being confronted by police.  He admitted to having an addiction to the internet due to his own crippling loneliness and social skills.  He became obsessed with Mark, and set up the entire charade to manipulate mark's naivete.  John fell into a spiral of depression over the thought of not being able to come clean to Mark, so he made up Janet and set up his own murder plot.  

Three months after the stabbing, John became the first person in British history to be charged with incitement of his own murder.  John was sentenced to a three year supervision order and banned from all online chat rooms while Mark was sentenced to a two year supervision order."
105,Louise Bell,1/26/2019,1:07:33,Elsha McGill,Elsha McGill,3.78,259,Solved,1/4/1984,Australia,South Australia,Adelaide,1,Louise Bell,10,F,Dieter Pfennig,35,M,"Abduction, murder, ransom",Unknown,,"Louise Bell was a 10 year old living in Adelaide with her family.  On January 4th, she and her younger sibling were sent to bed and told to keep the windows closed.  The following morning, their mother woke up to find Louise's younger sister asleep in bed, but Louise was nowhere to be found.  The window in Louise's room was found to be open and the screen slit at the corner so it flapped in the wind.  At first, officials were unsure of the circumstances - if Louise had left of her own will or if there was foul play involved - due to the lack of any evidence.  As such, the government only offered $5,000 as a reward, though local businessment donated a further $10,000.  Some days after her disappearance, the Bell family received a call from a man with a slight European accent who claimed to have taken Louise and was demanding $30,000.  As proof of who he claimed to be, he told them of a location where Louise's hoop earrings could be found under a rock near a busy intersection.  Investigators went there, and sure enough the earrings were found.  A neighbor found a wet, cut up pajama top in her yard and realized it may be connected to the missing local girl.  Louise's parents confirmed the top was Louise's and it appeared from the damage to the shirt that it had been cut off her while her arms were bound. 

Further investigation revealed that the shirt had microbiological substances and algae on it that could be connected to the Onkaparinga river.  In April 1983, an inmate at a local prison, 36 year old Raymond John Gacing, claimed to have murdered Louise and 4 other inmmates attested to that.  Gacing was a known sex offender who lived only 500 meters away from her home in Hackham West.  There were some connections between the Bells and Gacing - they lived close to each other, Gacing had been to the Onkaparinga River, and Gacing's wife had found a paper with the Bell's address on it.   He was charged with the abduction and murder of Louise.  In November 1984, he stood trial in S. Australia's supreme court, where only 2 of the 4 inmate's statements were regarded as admissible.  Gacing did not have a European accent, and the only physical evidence linking Gacing to Louise was that he had biological material from the river.  The circumstancial evidence was overwhelming, though, and he was sentenced to life in prison for the death of Louise.  Gacing maintained his innocence and continued to appeal his sentence.  

Later on, both inmates who provided testimony were found to have been untrustworthy (one admitted to fabricating his testimony), and so on appeal the verdict was reversed on April 12, 1985. Gacing was released from custody and his conviction was regarded to be a miscarriage of justice.  However, upon release he continued to prey on other children. He eventually arrested and convicted again on other charges and sentenced to 7 years in prison for crimes against two sisters over a span of 8 years.  Meanwhile, Louise's case was marked unsolved.  

In  December 1985, a colonial inquest was startd to look into Louise's disappearance with the goal of finding her body. They had no suspects, but they believed the suspect to be a tall, strong man who is very psychologically capable.   They regarded the abduction to be sexually motivated, and the suspect may be a sexual exhibitionist.  They found that the abduction was likely unrelated to any other missing children's cases in the area.   Louise's parents, Colin and Diane, found the inquest to be very painful and they released a statement that they wished to move on with their lives. 

On December 30, 1989, a 13 year old boy was riding his bike when a man tricked him into a vehicle where the boy was bound, gagged, and kidnapped.  The bike was wiped down near Maslin beach and abandoned to mislead the police.  The boy was held captive in a home in Hackham West and sexually assaulted. He managed to escape to the neighbors next door, where he managed to call police.  The abductor was arrested - 41 year old Dieter Pfennig, a math and sciences teacher with a wife and two children.  He admitted to the crime, saying he ""just wanted a hug"".   While in custody, police recieved a tip that Pfennig may be connected to another crime; 11 months prior, January 18, 1989, another 10 year old, Michael Black, had also been kidnapped while biking and fishing at a Sturt reserve.  His belongings were found abandoned later on at the reserve, but with no sign of Michael.  While Pfennig was in custody for the assault of the 13 year old, a witness said that Pfennig had claimed to be at the reserve the same day Michael had been and had even helped the boy with his fishing line.  Police identified many similarities between the two cases, and Pfennig was charged with the murder of Michael Black.  And given the close proximity to Hackham West, they began to connect Pfennig to Louise Bell.  

""Pfennig was known to frequent the Onkaparinga River, he lived within 7 minutes walk from the Bell home, and had opportunity to take her. Pfennig claimed to have been on holiday (and using a rental car service during that time, as an alibit) during the time Louise was taken, however. Police tracked down the rental company and found that Pfennig had returned the car on January 4, 1983, which would allow him to be back in Adelaide that night while his family remaind on holiday in Swan Hill. Pfennig pleaded guilty for the 13 year old boy, but pleaded not guilty for the case of Michael Black. The judge allowed """"similar fact"""" evidence in the trial - which means the other cases could be brought up in the Michael Black trial. This is very rare for a judge to do, but the judge felt that Pfennig's behavior and prior treatment of children was relevant to the Michael Black case. Pfennig was sentenced to 38 years in prison for Michael's murder. However, investigators still had not found a solid lead between Pfenig and Louise. At one point, investigators thought that Louise may be connected to Sian Kingi murderers Barrie Watts and Valmae Beck. But there was no connection. Louise's case went cold. 

By 2009, the case was reopened with the hopes that new forensic tech could advance the investigation. The technology found traces of new DNA evidence on the pajama top, but the technology wasn't advanced enough until 2012 to create a DNA profile based off such a small sample. The DNA was matched to a man already in prison for crimes in South Australia: Dieter Pfennig. In 2012, police returned to Pfennig's address he'd lived at during the 1980s. Radar was used to identify abnormalities in the ground of the property. Unfortunately the dig found nothing. Some inmates of Pfennig's came forward to say he had made a confession to them about both Michael Black and Louise Bell. He had refused to admit to the location of Black's body because """"there's a chick there"""" too: Louise. On November 13, 2013, Pfennig was arrested for Louise's death. He faced a judge alone in court, no jury, in an attempt to avoid a miscarriage of justice situation since the case was so highly publicized. The prosecutor argued that it was likely that Louise was enticed out of the house by Pfennig, whose daughter played basketball with Louise. One of Louise's daughters testified against him as well as Pfennig's ex-wife. Various other witnesses came forward to testify regarding Pfennig's behavior during the time of Louise's disappearance. 

Pfennig had a heart attack during the trial and was hospitalized, but he was able to return to court 3 weeks later. A second DNA test of the shirt had a lower likelihood of a Pfennig match than the original test done by a dutch company with the most advanced DNA testing available at the time. The defense used this to draw doubt to the DNA evidence. They also argued that maybe the DNA was """"secondary transferred"""" to Louise's pajamas via Pfennig's daughter who played basketball with Louise. The defense did everything they could to draw doubt regarding the witnesses and physical evidence. Due to this being a judge-only trial, the trial dragged on with several adjournments. Finally in 2016, the judge found Pfennig guilty for the murder of Louise. He asked Pfennig to lead authorities to the bodies of Michael and Louise with the promise that his sentencing could be affected by his cooperation with the authorities in this. Pfennig did not do this and Louise's body still has not been found. As a result, he was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Along with his other convictions, his non-parole time was brought up to over 60 years. Defense attorneys continue to argue that the DNA evidence in this case is suspect and this decision will have negative impacts on the legal system. Authorities will not close the case until Louise's body is found."""
106,Peter Nielsen (2 parter),2/2/2019,2:17:26,Milly Raso,Milly Raso,4.05,346,Solved,2/24/2004,Switzerland,Bulach,Kloten,1,Peter Nielsen,38,M,Vitaly Kaloyev,48,M,Murder,Stabbing,Kaloyev wanting revenge for the death of his family.,"(Part 1) On July 1, 2002, Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937 (a Russian passenger jet carrying 69 people, including 45 children and 9 crew, piloted by Captain Alexander Mihailovich Gross and First Officer Oleg Pavlovich Grigoriev) and DHL Flight 611 (a cargo plane piloted by Captain Paul Phillips and First Officer Brant Campioni) collided in mid air over the German town of Uberlingen around 9:35 pm.   All 71 people aboard both planes were killed.  Initially it was not clear what caused the accident and various countries (in particular, Switzerland) involved speculated that it was possible the Russian pilots did not properly understand the English commands of the air traffic controller.  This was later disregarded, as English is the de facto language of air traffic professions and the Russian pilots were well versed in flight English.   It was also considered that perhaps the Russian plane was defective, since itw as a Tupolev jet - a brand which had had around 30 air disasters since its inception.  The darkness of the night sky that night also led to speculation that the planes could not see each other.  

An investigation into the crash (using the black boxes and cockpit recordings from both planes) ultimately revealed that, once air traffic control saw the two planes were in each other's paths,  the DHL plane was ordered by both their Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and the air traffic controller to descend while the Tupolev passenger jet was given conflicting orders, one by  TCAS to ascend and one by the air traffic controller to descend. Audio recordings from the Russian cockpit revealed that the pilot and his fellow officers argued over which command to follow and ultimately it was decided by the senior officer to follow the air traffic controller's command to descend, despite the unease of the other officer present.   Due to the dark sky from the lack of moonlight and the fact that the air traffic controller incorrectly told the Russian plane that the incoming traffic was at the 2:00 position when it was actually at the 10:00 position, the two planes did not actually see each other until it was far too late for them to maneuver out of each other's way.  At that point, the Russian plane was going to cross directly over the DHL plane.  The vertical stabiliser on the back end of the DHL plane sliced through the body of the  Russian plane, causing an immediate loss of oxygen (and the loss of consciousness of all on board) in the Russian aircraft, which started to break to pieces above Uberlingen.  The loss of the vertical stabiliser caused the DHL pilots to lose control over the flight; it struggled to fly for a few more kilometers before crashing into a wooded area nearby.  

Further investigation into what really happened at air traffic control, Skyguide.  Skyguide initially stated that the planes were given warnings to ascend and descend, respectively, 2 minutes prior to the crash.  However, the black box data and cockpit recordings showed that to be false - the orders were given a mere 43 seconds before the crash and conflicting orders were given to the Russian plane.   The air traffic control crew on duty that night were tested for drugs and alcohol, but all came back negative.  For a long time, the controller in charge of these flights remained anonymous, but he was eventually revealed to be 36 year old Peter Nielsen, a 10 year veteran controller with a largely umblemished record (excepting a single incident a year prior which did not result in any loss of life) who was well regarded by his peers.  

""(Part 2) Vitaly Kaloyev was a Russian architect working in Spain on contract.  Near the end of his contract, he invited his wife and kids to come out to visit him and see Spain.  His wife and two children got on the same flight the Russian school children had chartered to Spain.  He got the news over radio the next day that a flight from Russia had been downed over Germany.  When he went to the crash site to identify the bodies, he found both of his children's bodies (as they were the two youngest on board).  Kaloyev lost himself to grief and spent much of the next year or two in mourning and spending most of his time by his wife and children's graves.  He tried to contact Skyguide, the air controller company in charge of the air space where the crash occurred, to find out more about what caused this disaster, but they deflected blame, avoided communication, and tried to pay off victim's families in return for no legal action.  After nearly 2 years of sidestepping and refusal to apologize by Skyguide and its company director Alan Rossier, Kaloyev took matters into his own hands and hired a private investigator to discover the identity of Peter N. - the only name partially released in relation to the crash.   The PI found the full name and address of Peter Nielsen for Kaloyev, and so Kaloyev went to confront Peter with pictures of his children's dead bodies.  

Kaloyev later claimed that he just wanted to talk and get some answers from Peter, and things would have gone differently if Peter had invited him in and perhaps acted with less of what Kaloyev perceived to be arrogance and disregard, but the conversation outside of Peter's house didn't last long before Kaloyev stabbed him to death with Peter's wife and children watching.  Kaloyev fled to his hotel near the airport and police found him shortly thereafter.  He at first denied any wrong doing, but there was clear evidence that he did it -  including his fingerprints on the knife and receipt of his purchase of the knife.  He admitted to doing it, but showed no remorse.  He was found guilty in trial and condemned to 8 years in prison, but he ultimately only spent 3 years doing time before he was returned to Russia.  Many Russians consider him a hero for defending his children's honor.  He continues to show no remorse to this day.

Either because of the murder of Peter Nielsen or just due to tragic timing, the investigation into the crash was completed shortly after Nielsen's death.  It found Nielsen not responsible in any way.  It found several contributing factors to the crash:  It was standard practice at Skyguide for the night shift to be very lightly staffed since the airspace was normally very empty during night.  Negligent behavior was tolerated by Skyguide, including allowing controllers to largely sleep through their shifts rather than watching the radars.  Maintenance work was being done on the night of the crash that hampered the controller's ability to do their job properly by both delaying the radar and disabling phone communications as well as the early alert system, and this maintenance work and how it would impact the equipment was not properly explained to the controllers before their shift.   Peter Nielsen was one of two controllers on shift that night, but the other controller left to take a nap.  Nielsen was running back and forth between two stations trying to do the job of two people by 1. safely bringing a plane into landing and 2. guiding the Russian and DHL planes away from each other.  Nielsen was unaware of the impact the maintenance work would have on the radar and his communication abilities were limited, so from his end of things, he was doing everything properly and efficiently.  He did give the two planes incorrect information regarding the 2:00 vs 10:00 location, but the investigation chalked that up to being confused from having to handle two situations at once.   The investigation did not hold Peter Nielsen in any way responsible for the crash.  Furthermore, it was found that similar near-miss crashes nearly occurred in other places (one in particular over Japan), but no action was taken by any governing flying body (like the international civil aviation organization) to ensure nothing like that happened again.  It was only after the Uberlingen Crash that policies were instituted to help avoid such situations in the future (including a policy which stated that, if given conflicting information from controllers and TCAS, prioritize TCAS). 

A trial went ahead and held eight Skyguide managers and employees responsible for 71 cases of negligible homicide.  Three of the four managers convicted were only given suspended prison terms and the fourth had to pay a fine.  The other four were cleared of wrongdoing.  Russians and the families of the victims found these punishments to be laughably insufficient.  Skyguide only released a generic apology and responsibility statement after the conclusion of the trial, and Alan Rossier was let go from the company.  

Peter Nielsen is included in memorials as part of the 72 people who lost their lives as a direct result of this crash. """
107,Lucie Blackman & Carita Ridgway,2/23/2019,1:32:00,Catherine Seccombe,Catherine Seccombe,3.82,240,Solved,1992-2000,Japan,Kanto,Tokyo,2,"Carita Ridgway, Lucie Blackman","21, 21","F, F",Joji Obara,"40, 48",M,"Serial assault and rape, murder","Poisoning, overdose",Sexual desire,"Carita Ridgway was a 21 year old Australian model temporarily living and working in Japan with her sister in 1992.  She was attempting to save up money for her upcoming wedding and acting classes she wished to take.  She worked as a hostess and on February 29, 1992, her douhan (paid date) drugged her, raped her, and video taped the act.  She was dropped off at a hospital, unconscious, and after some life-saving procedures failed to revive her, she was declared brain dead.  

Lucie Blackman was a 21 year old English woman working as a hostess in Japan as a way to save up money and pay off some debts she had.  She was living and working with her friend, Louise Kerton.  On July 1, 2000, Lucie went on a douhan and was scheduled to spend time with Louise later that night after her date.  She called Louise to confirm their plans, but the set time came and went without Lucie arriving home.  Louise waited a couple of days before reporting Lucie because they were technically illegally working in Japan.  She reported Lucie's disappearance to the Japanese police, but felt they did not take her report seriously.  Louise received a call from Lucie's date, who claimed Lucie had decided to join a cult. Louise made Lucie's family aware of her disappearance, and some family members travelled to Japan and started to put pressure on the police via the media.  Lucie's case received very high press coverage both in Japan and internationally.  Five days after Lucie's disappearance, a report was made to Tokyo police from an apartment manager stating that one of his tenants had been making odd noises in his apartment.  Police visited this tenant - Joji Obara - and found his apartment in dissaray, with cement chunks and a bulky sack laying about. The police couldnot investigate further due to not having a warrant.

After months of appeals, three women came forward stating that they experienced situations that bore similarities to Lucie's - they had been western women working as hostesses in Japan who had been on douhans, blacked out, and woke up to their date giving them an excuse for their unconsciousness.  They both reported their assaults to the Japanese police, who did not take their reports seriously.  The police made the possible connection between the assaults and Joji Obara due to the fact that he had a police record of an assault from the 1980s, and the western women came forward to confirm their attacker was Joji.  

""Police got a warrant to search Joji's apartment and found a collection of hundreds of video tapes and records of assaults of tens of women. The modus operandi was always the same: drugging the women into unconsciousness and assaulting them for upwards of 10+ hours. Police also found receipts of a chainsaw and a shovel. Obara denied any involvement and claimed the sexual activities in the videos were all consensual. 

When Obara's name and face were published in the media, Carita Ridgway's family recognized him as the man who had dropped her off at the hospital and who had later met with them to establish his story - he and Carita had been on a date, and she had become ill after eating bad food. A piece of liver the hospital had taken from Carita was tested and found traces of chloroform, and Carita was also found as one of the victims in his video tapes. A diary entry from Obara regarding Carita mentioned that he had used too much chloroform. 

Police had conducted several searches for Lucie's body at Obara's various properties (as he was a wealthy man with many homes), and finally, seven months after her disappearance, Lucie's body was found semi buried and partially encased in cement by a small cave on the beach near his apartment. Obara was charged with drugging, raping, and killing Lucie, the rape of six other women, and the manslaughter of Carita. Since the Japanese judicial system has strict rules regarding concrete evidence in trials (as opposed to circumstantial evidence), the prosecutor could not provide concrete evidence linking Obara to Lucie's death. Therefore, he was acquitted of Lucie's murder, but he was found guilty of the multiple rape charges and manslaughter of Carita and was subsequently jailed for life.""

",M,"Murder, kidnapping",Strangulation,,"Vlado Taneski was a crime reporter in Macedonia.  He had been laid off from his full time work, but he caught a lucky break when he started writing on breaking news - the murders of Mitra Simjanoska, Ljubica Licoska, and Zivana Temelkoska.  Violent crimes were rare in Kicevo, so Taneski used the opportunity to pitch the crimes to a Macedonian newspaper.  His articles on the subject became widely read and he became more respected as a journalist.  

Two young men, Ante Risteski and Igor Mirceski, were arrested and charged with Simjanoska's murder (as well as the murder of Radoslav Bozhinoski, an old man killed in 2004.  The police were treating these two separate incidents as a double homicide).  During pre-trial interrogation, Risteski and Miceski had confessed to both murders, however they later recanted the Simjanoska confession and said they were coerced under duress to confess.   Mirceski and Risteski were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison for the murders.  It was later revealed, however, that traces of semen found in Simjanoska did not match the DNA of either man. 

Lubica Licoska's body was found in February 2007 after she had been missing for three months. Like Simjanoska, she had been held hostage for months, abused, and then killed shortly before her body was discovered.  Around this time, police recalled a similar case of an older woman who worked as a cleaner (as Licoska and Simjanoska did), Gorica Pavelska, who had gone missing in May 2003 and who has never been found. 

On May 7, 2007, Zivana Temelkoska disappeared and, unlike the others, her body was found dead only a week later.  But like the others, she was also sexually and physically abused.  

Taneski ramped up his investigation into the crime by interviewing police detectives on the case and family members of the victims.  He kept the public informed with his series of articles on the crimes. Based on the DNA evidence in each case, police were able to narrow down a pool of suspects over time.  Taneski was included in this pool of possible suspects.  Police became suspicious of him when he revealed in one of his articles the method of murders - strangulation via a phone cord - because that detail had been purposefully kept out of the media.  Three independent lab tests confirmed that semen taken from Simjanoska and Temelkoska was Taneski's, and hairs found near Licoska's body were Taneski's. On June 20, 2008, Taneski was arrested in connection to the three murders and police wanted to find possible links between him and the 2003 disappearance of Pavelska. 

On June 23, 2008, while in custody, Taneski was found dead in his cell.   There was a suicide note found nearby, but there is debate about whether his death was actually a suicide.  By Macedonia law, a dead person cannot be put on trial, so the murders of the three victims never went to trial.  

Some of Taneski's motives could be drawn from his complicated relationship with his mother, who had died before the murder spree began.  Some of the women had been dressed his Taneski's mother's clothing while they were abused, murdered, and disposed. 

Note: the victims are as follows:

Their destination was a conservation rally in Albury and they hitchhiked their way south down the Hume Highway to get there. They were last seen on December 30, 1989, near the Belanglo forest.  The day after the couple’s disappearance, James’s backpack was found on Galston Gorge Road, 150 km away from Belanglo and in the opposite direction of where James and Deborah had been intending to travel 

Simone Schmidl was a German hitchhiker who was travelling alone through Australia.  She was a passionate traveller and met friends along the way, but during one particular stretch of her journey, she went hitchiking alone along the Hume Highway despite her friends and family asking her not to and offering to pay for transportation. She was last seen in January of 1991.

Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were a young German couple that had travelled together to many places throughout the world.  They came to Australia, but found it wasn't to their taste.  The last contact that Gabor had with his family, he expressed unhappiness with Australia and desire to leave as soon as possible.  They had been missing since December of 1991, last seen near the Sydney suburb of Kings Cross. 

Caroline Clark and Joanne Walters were two British backpackers who had met and bonded while in Australia and decided to continue travelling together.  They worked odd jobs like fruit picking to fund their journeying.  They were last seen in Kings Cross in April 1992.

As the family members of the missing people, in particular those of Clark and Walters, pressed Australian officials to take the cases seriously, some tips and sightings were reported.  Though most of the sightings were thought to be false, the increasing media attention led the press to look into various cases of missing international travellers to find possible connections.  The Hostel industry came under fire and press denouncing hitchiking as dangerous was released. 

In September 1992, members of the Orienteering Club discovered a decaying body in Belanglo forest.  They reported the find to police, who discovered a second body near the first the next day.  

Items near the body indicated that the two bodies were British travelers Caroline Clark and Joanne Walters, which was later confirmed by forensic testing. Forensic experts determined that both women had died to ferocious attacks.  Neither had defensive wounds, indicating they had been bound.  Joanne had 14+ stab wounds in her torso, and she had been gagged with a cloth tied in an over-under knot.  Caroline had been shot in the head ten times and she also had a knife wound in her back. Ballistics showed the bullets came from a 22 caliber rifle.  Near Caroline’s body were discarded cigarette butts, which indicated the perpetrator may have spent a long time committing the attack and attending the scene.  Due to how far away the crime scene was from the road, police believed the killer was familiar with the forest, perhaps a local.  Police continued searching the area for additional evidence, but nothing was found.

On Oct 5, 1993, a local man named Bruce Pryor was gathering wood in the forest when he came across human remains.  He notified police of his finding, and when police arrived, they found another body near the first remains.  Panty hose tied in a slip knot was found, as well as electrical tape, clothing, shoes, and cloth that seemed to have been used as a gag.  Post mortem examination revealed these bodies to be that of James Gibson and Deborah Everest, which surprised police since they had only been considering foreign travelers up to this point.  Deborah Everest had suffered severe blunt force trauma to her head and jaw as well as some knife wounds to her head.   James was found in the fetal position and he had been stabbed 7+ times.  Neither had defensive wounds, which indicated they had been restrained.  The fact that James’s backpack had been found a day after they were last seen (and the backpack contained pine needles like those found in Belanglo, while Galston Gorge Road has no pine trees), led investigators to believe that James and Deborah were killed the very day that they were last seen alive.  

Assistant Commissioner Clive Small led Task Force Air, a police force designated to investigate the four deaths.  The investigation was slow going and not a lot of headway was made.  Further searches of the forest did not reveal any more evidence.  Since it was very difficult to identify the knife or knives used in the various attacks, police focused on the bullets found.  They began looking into gun owners who had 22 caliber rifles.  They requested any such owners to come forward so they could be eliminated from the investigation.  No major breakthroughs were made in the case, and the investigation slowed down.

""On Nov 1, 1993, a group of police did a final sweep of their area of the forest when they came across remains. The body was later identified as Simone Schmidl. She had been stabbed multiple times with extreme force. Near her body was found clothing, rope, and wire tied in the shape of a noose. Investigators thought it would be unusual for all the victims to have been killed by the same killer, since serial killers usually don’t kill across genders or kill multiple people at once. 

On Nov 4, 1993, further search of the area near Simone’s body revealed two more bodies. Shoes, clothing, plane ticket, rope, electrical tape, and jewelry were found near the bodies. Dental records confirmed the bodies to be that of Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied. Anja had been stabbed multiple times in the torso and she had also been decapitated by a single powerful blow (her skull has never been found). Gabor had been shot six times in the head and he was likely strangled. He had been gagged using a reef knot, which was different from the knot used to gag Joanne. It indicated the possibility that perhaps more than one person was involved in committing the crimes. Near the area Gabor was found, more bullet containers and casings were found, which helped narrow down the type of guns used. 

Investigators found some differences between the murders. The earliest murders primarily involved stabbings and other knife wounds, while the violence of the crimes later escalated to include shootings and the decapitation. However, the similarities between the murders indicated they were connected. One of the guns used, a Rugger, likely had a silencer attached to it. An area near where Gabor was found seemed to have been used as a shooting range. The investigators looked into the brand and make of the bullets to help discover more about the perpetrator. The perpetrator had stabbed several of the victims in the same spot in the back, which would have rendered them paralyzed but kept them alive. Furthermore, several of the victims had been used as target practice for the perpetrator. Several of the victims may have also been sexually violated. All victims had been found face down, except James who was in the fetal position. As the violence of the attacks increased, the time the perpetrator spent committing the crimes and his level of confidence increased. All of the sites where bodies were found were similar in geography and each had makeshift firepits nearby. This indicated that perhaps the victims were lured by the campfire, or perhaps the killer camped out while he committed the crimes. Investigators were unsure if the crimes were committed by a single perpetrator or by multiple. Backpacks of all the victims, except James, remained missing. Police combed missing traveler records to see if any others could be potentially linked to the bodies found in Belanglo. 

On Nov 5, NSW police announced a large reward for any information leading to the arrest of the Belanglo killer. Hundreds more police were added to the Belanglo task force and the investigation continued to expand. Several separate investigations were all combined to form this task force, and this merging was a difficult process due to the various ways information had been stored and the massive amount of data from each investigation. Clive Small went out of his way to, with the help of others, create a new system (NetMap) which would import and organize all the data from the various investigations. This process took a large amount of time and effort, which delayed the investigation, but it organized nearly a million pieces of data into a manageable system. Further searches were conducted along Galston Road and in Belanglo, but no further evidence was found. The police were able to slightly narrow down the search on a more specific type of rugger rifle. People called in to the police hotline to report people who owned similar guns or had other similarities to the perpetrator. Two separate callers identified a man by the name of Ivan Millat. A third reported an incident a few years prior, when she was driving on the Hume Highway and saw two men struggling. One of the men jumped in her car and said the other had a gun, so she drove away.

In January 1990, British backpacker Paul Onions accepted a ride from a man named Bill along the Hume highway.  After some small talk, Bill threatened Paul with a gun, but Paul managed to escape by running from the car and diving into another car driving in the opposite direction.  Paul and the woman who rescued him both filed reports with the police regarding the incident, but Bill was not found.   In Nov 1993, when Paul heard the reports of the Belanglo serial killer, he contacted Australian police again regarding his experience. 

Criminal psychologists had differing opinions on the profile of the killer.  Initially, some psychologists believed the killer was actually two killers – a pair of brothers.  The FBI profiling team disagreed, however, and instead argued the killer was a single perpetrator.

Richard Millat worked at a building supply company.  The topic of the Belanglo murders was a popular conversation at the company.  Under the influence of drugs, Richard mentioned that he knew who killed the Germans. At this point, no Germans had been discovered.  Over several other conversations, he mentioned over things, such as “not all the bodies have been discovered” or “you could pick up anyone on that road and they’d never be found” or “stabbing a woman is like cutting a loaf of bread.”  The sinister remarks caused some of his coworkers to report him to police.  The Millat name had been known to Task Force Air since October 1993 – another family member, Alexander Millat, had claimed to see some women being taken (seemingly by force) by some men in two cars.   A third brother, Ivan, had been reported to the hotline due to the fact that he lived near Belanglo and owned guns.

Her friends and boyfriend informed the family that Rachel had made comments about some high paying job she was offered on the night she disappeared, and she was excited since the job would let her buy a pair of shoes she'd been eyeing.  This led some to speculate that Rachel had been forced into a prostitution ring, but this lead led nowhere.  One witness eventually came forward to say that she saw Rachel walking away with an older, plain looking female.  This eventually led to Caroline Robertson - the Barber family's old babysitter.  It became clear that Robertson was obsessed with Rachel due to her good looks, popularity, and talent.  After investigators combed Robertson's home and journal, it came out that Robertson had been stalking Rachel and trying to assume Rachel's identity.  Robertson admitted that she kidnapped Rachel under pretenses of a job, tried to drug her with ""drowsy powder"" on pizza they ate together, and then she strangled Rachel with a cord.

However, not enough evidence was found and the case went cold.  
In 2002, Heather Barnett, single mother of two, was found murdered in England.  At the time, Restivo lived nearby, and he was almost immediately a person of interest.  DNA evidence at the scene connected Restivo to Barnett.  He was also known locally as a creep who had a fetish for cutting hair.  
The body of Elisa Claps was discovered in 2008 in the attic of the church she and her family attended, and where many vigils had been held in her honor.  It was discovered that the church probably already knew about the body in the attic, and had not come forward with this information.  It was indicated that other sexual activities had been commited by the priests there.  DNA evidence in both cases tied Restivo to the murders.  In 2011 at a trial in England, Restivo was found guilty of Barnett's murder and sentenced to 40 years in prison, and that same year he was found guilty of Claps' murder and sentenced to 30 years in Italy. 
It is possible that Restivo is connected to other similar style murders in Europe.

He abducted six young girls, aged 10-18.  His usual modus operandi was, after abduction, to rape or assault them, then manually strangle them and dump their bodies on grassy areas near freeways in and around DC.  He deviated from this pattern in a couple of the cases: For third victim Brenda Crockett, the phantom coerced her into calling her family twice, perhaps as a way to taunt them.  Brenda was strangled with a scarf rather than manually.  And the fifth victim, Brenda Woodward, had a note from the killer found with her body: This is tantamount to my insensitivity to people especially women.  I will admit the others when you catch me if you can! Free-way Phantom

The Victims: 
Carol Spinks (April 25, 1972 - aged 13) was abducted while on an errand given by her older sister to pick up groceries at a local 7-eleven.  Her body was found six days later near I-295.

Darlenia Johnson (July 8, 1971 - aged 16) was abducted while on her way to her sumemr job.  One witness reported seeing her in an old black car that was driven by a black male shortly after her abduction.  Her body was discovered eleven days later only 15 feet from the location Spink's had been found.

Brenda Crockett (July 27, 1971 - aged 10) was abducted while she was out running errands at the store for her mother.  She failed to return home, and three hours after she left on the errand, the family phone rang.  Brenda's little sister answered, and Brenda reportedly said ""A white man picked me up and I'm heading home in a cab."" Brenda also stated she believed she was in Virginia somewhere.  Shortly after that, Brenda called again and repeated the same information.  A few hours after that, Brenda's body was discovered near US Route 50.  Police concluded the information Brenda gave over the phone was inaccurate information meant to divert the police so the Phantom had time to commit his acts.  

Nenomoshia Yates (October 1, 1971 - aged 12) was abducted while walking home from a Safeway store.  Her body was found a few hours later near the shoulder of Pennsylvania Avenuein Maryland. After this murder, the moniker ""Freeway Phantom"" started being used in media.  

Brenda Woodward (November 15, 1971 - aged 18) was abducted after leaving a friend's house, where she had dinner, to return to her home.  Her body was found approximately six hours later near Route 202.  She had been stabbed and strangled.  Her body held the note as transcribed above. 

Diane Williams (September 5, 1972 - aged 17) was abducted while on her way to visit her boyfriend.  Her body was found a short time later near I-295.  

Angela Denise Barnes (1971 - aged 14) was originally considered to also be a possible victim of the Phantom, but she had dissimilarities from the other victims (including the fact that she was shot).   A later investigation concluded that Angela was victim to a different killer.  Later on Edward Sullivan and Tommie Simmons, two ex-cops, were arrested for her murder

""There was much unrest in the DC community, which was 70% black, that the murders weren't being taken seriously due to the race of the victims. The police captain argued that the police department had worked hard on the cases and pointed blame to the media and news, who did not shine a light on black victims. 

The Green Vega Rapists were a gang considered to be suspects of the Phantom killings. This gang largely operated in DC and Maryland, commiting rapes and abductions. While some of the gang members seemed to have pointed fingers at each other, or while some imprisoned criminals may have had insider knowledge, no solid suspect was ever found. 

Outside of the gang, the strongest suspect was Robert Askins, a man who had previously served time for a 1938 murder of a DC prostitute. He was freed in 1958 based off a legal technicality. In 1977, police got a warrant to search his house where they found the appelate court's opinion from his conviction, which used the word """"tantamount"""". Police found the use of the word interesting since it matched the word used found in the note on one of the victims. Plenty of evidence was found in the house that linked Askins to other crimes, but not to the murders of the six girls. Askins was convicted of other crimes and received a life sentence, and he died in prison in 2010. 

Some detectives, like Romaine Jenkins, have since tried to solve the case. But there has been little reported headway since much of the evidence in the case was mishandled or lost. The case is still unsolved to this day."""

Investigators looked into Leeann's friend, who had expressed romantic interest in her.  But he was eliminated from the investigation.  Graeme gave several interviews with police, and seven years after her disappearance, Graeme was charged with her murder. Graeme's former partner had also reported him for stalking and domestic violence in the early 2000s, and her fear of him was so great that she changed her name and moved away.  A year after his arrest, Evans's lawyer wanted to discuss the possibility of a plea bargain under the ""no body, no parole"" rule.  Evans pleaded guilty and lead investigators to Leeann's body.  As a result, Graeme was sentenced to nine years in prison and is eligible for parole after four years.   This was the first case in Aus to be solved under the ""no body, no parole"" rule.

While out partying one night, Mark disappeared.  Police did not initially take the case seriously, as the area was flooded with tourists on spring break, and ""missing"" tourists usually turned up after a few days. The case drew a lot of attention in America due to the status of Mark's family, and the bad publicity caused Mexican officials to take the case more seriously. 

Initially, they thought it could be a case of robbery or a case involving drugs.  These leads and the growing publicity of the case did not go anywhere, unfortunately.  An unrelated incident - a speeding car that had run a red light - caused police to notice the driver, Serafin Hernandez.  Serafin and various of his family members were found to be members of a cult, led by Adolfo Constanzo.  This cult participated in ritual torture, sacrifice, and cannibalism and various other rituals in the hope of supernatural power.  Mark Kilroy's body parts were found at the ranch where these rituals would take place, alongside 14 other victims of the cult. 

Adolfo Constanzo, the leader of the cult, fled the area in an attempt to escape, but he was eventually found.  He ordered cult members to kill him before he could be arrested.  At trial in 1993, various cult members were found guilty and sentenced to 60+ years in prison.  

It is possible that there are more victims than the 14 (+Mark Kilroy) found at the ranch.   

As of today, two suspect members of the cult remain at large."

There were signs that someone had been inhabiting the home before, during, and after the death of the Grubers and Andreas had complained of noticing signs that someone was on his property but refused help to search. The last time young Cazilia was seen at school, she had made mention that no one slept well the previous night due to an argument.  Some theories include:

Karl Gabriel: Viktoria's husband and father to Cazilia, who was reportedly killed in action in WWI, may have actually just been in hiding.  He may have killed the entire family due to the incestuous relationship between Andreas and his daughter, Cazilia, a relationship that had been ongoing since she was young.

Lorenz Schlittenbauer: Likely the father of Viktoria's second child, Josef, he had a turbulent relationship with the Gruber's.  He was among the first group of people that discovered the bodies.  

Other theories abounded, all largely based on speculation.  Many rumors spread about the family due to the incestuous relationship between Andreas and Viktoria and how it may have been involved in someone being motivated to kill the entire family.  "

Multiple witnesses stated that he was last seen with 22 year old Afonso Dias, who denied this claim but made several cryptic comments to police, including that they should ""close the borders"".  Police unfortunately did not take this investigation very seriously.  Afonso was not taken to trial until 2012, where he was acquitted due to lack of evidence.  In 2014, he was tried again and this time convicted only of corruption of a minor and sentenced to 3 years in prison, of which he only served 2/3rds.  

Rui Pedro has remained missing.  Some possible sightings have been made over the years, including a potential sighting on a ride at Disneyland Paris in April 1998. In September 1998, Rui Pedro was identified as one of only 16 children identified in over 750,000 child pornography images confiscated from a multinational pedophile ring.  The British investigation, coined Operation Cathedral, identified Rui Pedro as a victim of the ring, but were unable to find any further leads to his whereabouts.

They were abandoned when the skipper and boat workers did not do a proper headcount to ensure all passengers (26 total) were aboard ship before they departed for the day.  The missing couple were only noticed after two days, but by that time they were nowhere to be found.  Various items from the couple - including a plea for help written on Tom's diving board - were found.   

The owner of the boat and diving team - Nairn  was charged with unlawful killing, but found not guilty.  His lawyer argued that since no bodies had been found, and since Tom and Eileen had expressed some negative world views (taken out of context) in their journals, he argued that they had faked their deaths to start a new life elsewhere.  The judge found this argument unrealistic, but also found Nairn not guilty.  The Australian scuba diving world then underwent an overhaul in rules and safety regulations."

He grew up with a mother who excused all of his bad behavior.  He and his brother attempted a bank robbery (on the advice of a neighbor who had gotten rich this way years before) in 1926, but were caught and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The brothers were released by a monetary bribe from their mother.    Ratliff soon planned another bank robbery, this time for the bank in Cisco, TX.  He assumed that townspeople would not have the guts to stand up to armed robbers (despite a law in TX stating that anyone who shoots a robbery under proper circumstances would received a $5k rewards).  Marshall got a group of four total men together to rob this bank on the last Friday before the bank would close for the holidays - since that is when the bank would be holding the most money. As Ratliff was known in the Cisco community, he wore a santa suit / mask he borrowed from his landlady (who also had helped them procure items for the robbery) to hide his identity.  

Ratliff and his gang parked their stolen car in a back alley (where the bank had  rear exit) and entered the bank.  Ratliff's diguise backfired, since he was recognized by at least one citizen in the bank, and local children wanted to come up and chat with santa.  One woman with such a child managed to sneak out of the bank through one of the employee offices and she alerted the public to the robbery.  Contrary to Ratliff's belief that citizens would not intervene in a robbery, local men had set up a blockade outside of the bank and shots were traded between the robbers and the civilians. (It is unknown who fired the first shot).  Some police, including Chief Bedford and Deputy Carmichael, arrived to help.  Both officers were mortally wounded during this gunfight.  The robbers took two children, Laverne Comer (12) and Emma May Robertson (10), to use as human shields while they escaped down the alley to their car.  Despite the shields, a couple of the robbers sustained serious injuries as they escaped with $12,400.

""A car chase ensued. Near the edge of town, one of the tires of the robber's vehicle was shot out and they realized they had forgotten to fill up their tank, so they stole a car from a passerby (14 year old Woodrow Harris). The money and four robbers transferred to the new car, but they could not escape with this car, since Harris had taken the keys with him when he gave up the car. The robbers returned to their original car, but abandoned Davis, who was unconscious, in the new car. Later on, they realized they had forgotten the money in the new car, too. The mob found Davis and the money in the new car and temporarily gave up chase. The mob took Davis to a hospital, but he was unable to survive his wounds. This was the first crime Davis had ever committed, as he was a last-minute addition to the gang. The other three robbers continued their escape. There were several clashes between the robbers and police. During one such clash, Ratliff was injured and captured, but Hill and Helms continued to run. The last two robbers were captured on Dec 30, seven days after the robbery. The three surviving robbers lived long enough to go to trial. 

Helms was identified as the man who had gunned down the two deceased police officers and was sentenced to death. He was executed on Sep 6, 1929. Hill was sentenced to life imprisonment (99 years). He escaped prison three times, but was recaptured each time. He was released on parole in the 1940s and he then changed his name and lived a peaceful life until he died of natural causes in 1996. Ratliff was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life in prison. In a separate trial, he was also sentenced to death for his involvement in the deaths of the officers (though no eye witnesses saw the Santa robber shoot at the police). Ratliff appealed this, but failed. He attempted to have the death sentenced repealed by an insanity plea, so he began to act bizarrely. The citizens that lived in the county where this robbery had occurred were frustrated with how legal proceedings were going in Ratliff's case and frustrated that he hadn't been executed yet. On Nov 18, 1929, Ratliff feigned paralysis in his cell, and his two jailers came to help him. During this, Ratliff managed to get a gun from the officers and fatally shot one of them, Tom Jones. The other officer, Pack Kilbourn, managed to beat Ratliff into unconsciousness and return him to his cell. A mob had gathered outside the jail by that time. The following day, the mob overtook the jail and dragged out Ratliff to hang him. It took two tries, but Ratliff died at 9:55 pm on November 19, 1929. No one was ever tried for this lynching."""

They took a family camping trip to Uluru in August 1980.  While on this trip, Azaria was taken and killed by a dingo - a wild dog / wolf native to Australia.  Fellow campers witnessed the panic of the Chaimberlains and helped search for the baby. Initial reports of the event supported the Chaimberlains and their version of the story, but the media quickly turned against the family.  Lindy came across in the media as cold and unlikeable, their religion was scrutinized, and there was a general belief that a dingo couldn't / wouldn't attack humans.  The media frenzy turned public opinion severely against the Chaimberlains, in particular Lindy, who was portrayed to be a careless, heartless baby murderer.  

Lindy was tried for murdering Azaria and, despite the prosecution's case being entirely made up of circumstantial evidence and speculation, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1982. Lindy and her legal team exhausted every appeal option they had available, but to no avail.  In 1986, the chance discovery of some of Azaria's clothing in a dingo lair confirmed the Chamberlain's version of the story and Lindy was released from prison.  The convictions against Lindy and her husband were overturned in 1988, but the Northern Territories government still did not treat the case as an animal attack - even after multiple inquests, they listed Azaria's death as an ""open"" finding in 1995.  Azaria's death was not listed as killed by a dingo until another inquest in 2012 - 32 years after her death.  The shameful behavior of the northern territories government, coroner, police department, and media turned a tragedy into a complete circus that ruined the lives of the Chamberlain family.  Rumor and speculation surrounds Lindy Chamberlain to this day. "

On Oct 12, 1974 around 11:30 pm, they had an argument and Arlis (a devoutly religious woman) insisted on going to the Stanford chapel to pray. She didn't come home that night, and Bruce reported her missing to the police by 3:00 am.  Her body was discovered by Stephen Crawford, a police guard, at 5:45 am.  She was found dead in the chapel with a broken ice pick stuck in the back of her head.  She had also been strangled and suffered sexual assault with a couple altar candles.  DNA evidence was found in the case, but wouldn't be useful to this case for decades until DNA forensic technology became viable.

The police investigation initially focused on Bruce, as he had admittedly had an argument with Arlis that night. Police also focused on the seven people who were known to have entered the chapel around that time - Arlis, Stephen Crawford, four others that were later ruled out, and an unknown man with sandy-colored hair that has never been identified. Crawford remained a suspect due to some of his timeline and story not matching up - but his lies were assumed to be him covering up misbehavior at his job, not a connection to the murder - and nothing solid at the time could link him to the case.  Crawford continued to be a suspect over the years and even was found to have stolen large amounts of valuables from Stanford while he worked there.  For this he recieved felony charges.  The Arlis Perry case went cold.

Over the years, the case was considered to possibly be connected to both Ted Bundy and David Berkowitz, but there is no evidence to suggest this. The case was possibly thought to be connected to the John Getreu murders: Getreu had murdered at least 2 women in 1973-1974 (21 year old Leslie Perlov in Stanford CA and 21 year old Janet Taylor in Woodside CA).  Getreu's cases went unsolved until 2018 when DNA evidence linked him to the crimes.  He currently is awaiting trial and has been connected to further assaults and attempted murders. Police are continuing to search for possible connections to other cold cases, as well.  Getreu spent 2 years in prison in Germany for raping and murdering a girl while he was a minor living there with his military father. 

By 2018, DNA forensics had become advanced enough to test the DNA evidence found at the Arlis Perry crimescene and it was definitively matched to Stephen Crawford.  When police went to confront Crawford and search his residence, Crawford committed suicide. "
138,The Batavia,2/29/2020,1:24:10,Erin Munro,Erin Munro,3.92,154,Solved,1629,Australia,Beacon Island,Morning Reef,110-125,,,,Jeronimus Cornelisz,31,M,"Massacre, Mutiny","Stabbing, drowning, bludgeoning, suffocation, stabbing.",,"In 1628, the ship Batavia of the Dutch East India company set sail on its maiden voyage from Texel, Netherlands, to Batavia (modern day Jakarta, Indonesia). Batavia was the capital of the Dutch East Indies at the time and the ship was carrying large amounts of gold and silver.  The ship was commanded by Francisco Pelsaert with skipper Ariaen Jacobsz as the second in command (these two were rumored to not be on good terms).  Junior merchant Jeronimus Cornelisz, a former pharmacist from Haarlem, was also on board as he attempted to flee the Netherlands and his debt.  Cornelisz had a poor reputation because of his association with painter Johannes van der Beeck and the Roscicurcian society, a society accused of having atheistic and satanic beliefs.  341 total people were aboard the ship.

As the voyage made way, Cornelisz made friends with Jacobsz and they both started to form a plan for mutiny so they could take the valuables and ship for themselves.  They planned to harass and assault a wealthy woman on board, Lucretia Jans, while disguised so that Pelsaert would punish the crew (and thus motivate the crew to be dissatisfied with Pelsaert and more willing to join a mutiny. This fail, however, since Lucretia was able to identify her attackers. 

On Jun 4, 1692, the ship struck Morning Reef near Beacon Islands (close to the western coast of Australia).   Of the 341 on board, all but 40 were able to swim to Beacon Island.  The ~300 survivors of the shipwreck realized the island did not have a fresh water source and no reliable food source.  Pelsaert organized a group, including Jacobsz and some senior officers, to take their longboat and sail a month-long journey to Java, Indonesia, to find help. Pelsaert did not leave anyone in charge of the other survivors staying behind on Beacon Island.  

Cornelisz was left with the survivors and was able to establish himself as a leader of the group. As no leader had been appointed by Pelsaert, this was technically not a mutiny. He managed to separate the survivors so that he maintained control of most of their supplies, and he separated the strongest onboard (including the soldiers) under pretenses of searching for food and water. He and some men who had agreed with his original mutiny plan aboard the Batavia quickly became criminal and murderous.  They picked off many people who opposed them and those who they would have to share the limited food and water supply with. At first these murders were done secretly, but Cornelisz's rule became more openly violent as more of his opposers were killed.  Over a two month period, Cornelisz and his followers killed between 110 and 124 men, women, and children by strangulation, drowning, bludgeoning, and stabbing.   Seven women were kept alive to be forced into sexual slavery for Cornelisz and his men.  Lucretia Jans, the prettiest, was kept exclusively for Cornelisz.  Cornelisz and his men then began targeting factions of other survivors who had gone to nearby islands in search of more food and water, since their collective numbers outnumbered his group's size.

Among the survivors that had gone to the other islands was a man named Wiebbe Hayes.  This group did find a new source of fresh water, and they sent up a smoke signal to bring others to their locations.  This brought together Hayes' group and survivors of Cornelisz's killings.  So thus Cornelisz and his band of men were now more outnumbered and Wiebbe's group had the main source of fresh water and a hastily made stonework defense to ward of attacks by Cornelisz.  Cornelisz made several attacks on Hayes' and his survivors, but was unsuccessful.  

At this time, October 1629 (about 4 months after he left), Pelsaert returned with a rescue ship and more men.  Pelsaert would later claim that he arrived just in time to stop Cornelisz from massacreing everyone and stealing the rescue ship - but in reality, by this time Cornelisz and his group were largely outnumbered with few supplies.  Cornelisz and his men were tortued to confess of their crimes. Cornelisz was tried and found guilty of mutiny.  He and a half dozen of his men had their hands amputated (by hammer and chisel) and then hung on the island. Some of the ""minor offenders"", including young boys like Wouter Loos and Jan Pelgrom de Bye, were marooned on the western Australia coast.  It is unknown what happened to them after that, but it is possible they were the first Europeans to become residents of Australia.The rest of the mutineers were taken in captivity to Java and most of them were executed.  Ariaen Jacobsz likely died in the dungeons of Castle Batavia.  

The VOC (the Dutch East India Company) were unimpressed with Pelsaert's handling of the ship and did not give him the position in Batavia he had originally been promised at the start of the voyage.  He died in 1630 and the VOC retained most of his earnings. Soldier Wiebbe Hayes was hailed as a hero for his acts during the reign of Cornelisz's terror and for protecting other survivors.  He was given a promotion to Sergeant and placed in charge of the remaining surviving soldiers.  As this is the last mention of him in the public record, it is unknown what the rest of his life was like. The stone fort that he and his men made on West Wallbi island is the oldest surviving European structure in Australia. Lucretia Jans survived and was initially put on trial for her part in the action of Cornelisz's men, as she was kept as Cornelisz's personal sex slave.  She denied the charges, and it appears that she was acquitted. She returned to the Netherlands in 1635.  Of the 12 chests of gold and silver originally on the Batavia, 10 were able to be recovered by the rescue ship Sardam.  Of the two remaining chests, one had been trapped under a cannon in the wreck, and the other had been broken into by mutineers.  

In the modern day, the wreck of the Batavia was first sighted in 1963 and much of the wreckage was salvaged in the 1970s. The wreckage site is today a popular diving spot on the western Australian coast."
139,Beryl & Geraldine Evans (2 parter),3/13/2020,3:11:39,"Anonymous Host, Erin Munro",Erin Munro,3.84,103,Solved,"Nov 10, 1949",England,West London,Notting Hill,2,"Geraldine Evans, Beryl Evans","1, 20","F, F",John Christie,50,M,Murder,"Strangulation, assault",,"Timothy and Beryl were a young married couple (25, 20) who had moved to Notting Hill around 1948.  At this time, it was a poorer neighborhood that had suffered from the bombings of WWII.  Various people had different views of their relationship - some thought Timothy and Beryl fought too much, while others believed it was a healthy, loving relationship.  They had one daughter, Geraldine.  Around this time, Beryl discovered she was pregnant, but she absolutely did not want to go through with it.  She wanted an abortion, which was illegal in England at the time.  Timothy told his wife she would do no such thing, but eventually relented. 

Weeks after this, on November 30, 1949, Timothy informed police that his wife was dead.  Timothy gave several versions of the events that had transpired.  In the first, he claimed that a strange man he'd met by chance had given him pills that would induce an abortion in his wife.  Timothy claimed that he told his wife to not touch the pills, but the next day he came home to find her dead.   He claimed he had dumped her body down a hole covered by a manhole covering.  Police did not believe this story and opening the covering did not reveal any body.   After this, Timothy changed his story: he claimed that his neighbor, John Christie, had offered to perform an abortion on Beryl.  Christie said he had medical training and could perform the procedure, but at a 10% risk of death. Beryl  wanted to go through with the procedure, while Timothy did not want her to.  He came home from work to be informed by Christie that the procedure did not work and Beryl was dead.  Christie told Timothy he would dispose of the body and arrange for friends to take care of Geraldine while Timothy left the area to lay low for a while.  Christie would later refuse to let Timothy see Geraldine when he returned to find her.

Beryl and Geraldine's bodies were found wrapped in tablecloths in an outdoor wash house in the back garden of the Notting Hill homes.  Both were dead by strangulation.  This was apparently the first time Timothy had heard of Geraldine's death.  At this time, he allegedly confessed to the crime (claiming to have killed Beryl during an argument and strangling Geraldine two days later) - though it is debatable if this confession was coerced or not.  

Timothy was put on trial for the murder of Geraldine on January 11, 1950.  During the trial, Timothy claimed that Christie was responsible for the murders.  The procescution dismissed these claims as ""fantastic"" and used Christie and his wife Ethel as key witnesses against Timothy.  The trial largely became the word of Chrstie versus the word of Timothy.  The jury ultimately turned against Timothy and, after a trial of only three days and much omitted evidence, they convicted Timothy of murder.  He was executed by hanging on March 9, 1950. 

Three years later in 1953, Christie left the home he had been living in.  The landlord allowed Beresford Berown, a neighbor from  upstairs, to use the apartment's kitchen.  Brown discovered the bodies from three women (Kathleen Maloney, Rita Nelson, Hectorina Maclennan) hidden in the kitchen pantry (which was near the wash house where Beryl and Geraldine's bodies had been found).  Further searching led to the discovery of three additional bodies (Ethel Christie, Christie's wife, under floorboards of the front room; Ruth Fuerst and Muriel Eady, buried in the back garden).  Christie was arrested for murder and put on trial.  He was found guilty of murdering his wife and executed by the same hangman who had executed Timothy Evans 3 years prior.   Christie is now linked to seven murders of women (plus Beryl Evans' unborn child and Geraldine Evans, age 13 months).  These women were all aged 20-31, with the exception of Ethel Christie (54). Based on evidence collected at the scene, it is possible that Christie was responsible for more murders.  

An inquiry into Evans's case in 1965-1966 concluded that Evans' ""probably"" killed his wife, but Geraldine was killed by Christie. However, there was a large amount of uncertainty in the case that would have made it impossible for any jury to conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Roy Jenkins, the home secretary, recommended that Evans be posthumously pardoned - and this motion was granted.  It wasn't until 2003 that the home office awarded Evans' family compensation for the miscarriage of justice. This case played a major part in the abolition of the death penalty in the UK (1965)."

When she failed to show up for her flight to go back home to Alabama on May 30th, authorities were alerted to her disappearance.  Initially, local authorities believed she was just a partying tourist that was probably somewhere sleeping off a hangover.  

Natalee was last seen by her classmates getting into a car with local residents Joran van der Sloot and Deepak and Satish Kalpoe.  When later questioned, they said they had dropped Holloway off at her hotel and denied knowing what happened to her after that.  Van der Sloot was arrested twice and the Kalpoes were arrested three times each in connection to this case, but always were released without charges.  

In the years since Holloway's disappearance, van der Sloot has remained in the media spotlight.  Multiple times, he has gone on talk shows to tell the ""true story of what happened"" to Holloway in exchange for money - after which, he would claim he was lying during the shows / interviews.  He has given multiple confessions to the crime and multiple versions of his story, with his lies becoming more and more egregious, ranging from grinding up and burning her bones to selling her into sex slavery.  

[In my opinion, the most likely events are:] van der Sloot and his friends the Kalpoes were known in their area to try to get with as many girls as they could.  They were known to use date rape drugs.  As a naive tourist on a party vacation, Holloway would have been a prime target for such men.  I think it is most likely that she takern to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach  and was drugged and raped by van der Sloot and the Kalpoes on the night of May 29th / early morning May 30th.  Something killed her, whether it was a drug overdose or a choking on her own vomit or being killed by one or all three men involved. Her body was then disposed of, possibly into the ocean where it would be very unlikely, if not impossible, to be found again. 

Natalee's remains have never been found, but van der Sloot and the Kalpoes have continued to be prime suspects - in particular van der Sloot, who was later found to have murdered Stephany Flores in Peru on May 30, 2010 (the five year anniversary of Holloway's disappearance). For this crime, he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 28 years of imprisonment. He remains in prison to this day for the murder of Flores. 

Due to how the justice system works in Aruba, the case technically remains unsolved and, without new evidence, is unlikely to be opened again.  Despite this, the perpetrators are almost certainly known."

The two ""adult supervisors"" at the party were 18-19 year old drunk males, Matthew Webster and  Guy Wilson, also admitted to assaulting her.  Rumors around the party indicated that many more had attacked Leigh, that she had been gang raped, but no one came forward with information.  The police and judges involved in the case all participated in the victim blaming culture.  No rape or assault terminology was used in the legal documents and the boys were treated as though the sexual interactions were consensual.  Matthew Webster eventually confessed to the murder (some speculate he did it to take sole blame and protect the others involved) and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.  He served 14 years, which was the minimum.  Guy Wilson served six months for assault, and ""Corey"" served 100 hours of community service.  Other parties that may have been involved have never been brought to justice.  

Leigh and her family continued to be harrassed, victim blamed, and slut shamed by the people of Stockton.  "

He had violent behaviors from a very young age, and this lead him to a career in the military.  After his time in the military and an argument with his family over gay rights (after which he never spoke to most of them again), he moved to London to work at the metropolitan police and, later, as a civil servant. As a big city, there were many different sorts of people to meet and Nilsen made use of gay bars to meet likeminded people.  He engaged in several relationships, but up to this point had not killed anyone (but had assaulted and taken advantage of several people throughout his life). In December 1978, he encountered 14 year old Stephen Holmes.  He lured Holmes back to Nilsen's home where he plied the boy with alcohol.  The next day, while Holmes slept, Nilsen strangled him and then drowned him in a bucket of water because he didn't want Holmes to leave.  He kept the body under the floorboards and would masterbate over the body.  This became Nilsen's usual method - to drug the desired victim, strangle them and drown them, and stow the body away to be used again for sexual needs later.  The bodies would eventually be cut to manageable pieces and destroyed in bonfires. While living in this particular home at Melrose avenue in London, Nilsen is suspected to have killed as many as 12 men between 1978 and 1981. Some of the victims have never been identified by name, so the exact number is not known.  But the method for most of the victims was the same.  

In 1982, Nilsen moved to a new home in Cranley Gardens.  He did not have access to a garden or floorboards at this some since he was renting an attic apartment, and so he needed new methods to dispose of his victims. He decided, instead of bonfires, he would dissect the bodies and dispose of the pieces down drain pipes.  This would end up being his undoing, since the flesh and bones would come to block the drains at Cranley Gardens and the remains would be discovered when plumbers came to fix the issue.  The pipe from whence the body parts had come from was clearly Nilsen's, and police were called to inspect the home.  The body of Nilsen's final victim, Stephen Sinclair, was found partially dissected in the home when the police arrived. Nilsen was arrested and confessed to the crimes.

Nilsen was brought to trial on October 24, 1984, charged with six counts of murder and two attempted murder (some potential victims had managed to run away).  Nilsen pleaded not guilty, and his solicitors focused on his state of mind before, during, and after the murders as his defense.  Testimony from some survivors was given, and helped the prosecution establish that Nilsen was in full control of himself when the attacks happened.  Some of the victims had refused to report their assaults to police at thetime due to fear of their sexuality being discovered.  Nilsen's confession was used by the prosecution  and the much of the evidence in the case came directly from the confessions.  An investigator noted how unusual it is for a defendent to go into such detail during their confessions.  After much testimony, the jury returned on November 3 with a verdict of guilty on six counts of murder and one attempted murder.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 25 years."

He also had difficulty obtaining all the money he needed for some of his legal / parole issues thanks to Dalia.

The police set up an operation where they sent in a cop to pretend to be a contract killer.  This cop struck a deal with Dalia, and the date for Michael's 'death' was set.  Dalia got out of the house for the arranged time, and then cops contacted her to come home because there had been an incident with her husband and he was now dead.

Her body was discovered and she likely was killed between 9 pm September 27th and 8 am of the following day.  She had been sexually assaulted and then strangled / suffocated to death.

There were no signs of her apartment being broken into, so it is possible that she knew her attacker and let him in.  But it was later discovered that her apartment could be accessed via a small door in her closet which led to the attic - an attic that was shared between seven apartments. Thus anyone who had access to any of those apartments would have had access to Brittany's.  DNA and fingerprints were taken from the scene, but unfortunately they have not led anywhere in the case.  Some other items from the crime scene - in particular, a pillowcase - are believed to have possibly belonged to the perpetrator, but it is not known for sure.  The case almost recieved a breakthrough when a DNA sample from the apartment was matched to a man, but this man was found to have been a friend of Maggie's.  He had an alibi and the police did not charge him with any involvement.

Sams contacted police several times, threatening to firebomb a local store if he wasn't given ransom money.  None of the communications came to any fruition, however, and Julie's body was found nine days later.  Sams later confessed that she had attempted to escape and psychologists beleive Sams had always intended to kill her. 

On January 22, 1992, 25 year old estate agent Stephanie Slater was kidnapped by Sams and held in a cramped coffin-like box for eight days.  Sams continued to demand ransoms, similarly as he had done for Julie Dart.  Unlike Dart, Slater did not attempt to escape and largely played along with Sams.  Sams later released Slater back to her family.  Stephanie later admitted that Sams had raped her during her imprisonment.

At this point in time, police had no clue who the suspect was.  The case was higlighted on the tv show Crimewatch, where Sams' ex wife recognized his wife and several details about the perpetrator.  She and her son reported Sams to the police. This tip-off led Sams to be arrested and subsequently brought to trial.  He accepted responsibility for kidnapping the women, but claimed an unnamed accomplice had murdered Dart.  He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.  Three days after being imprisoned, he confessed to the murder as well.

During new years, 2000-2001, a stranger broke into the home of the Miyazawa family (via removing a screen in a second floor bathroom) and murdered all four family members one by one.  First, 6 year old Rei was strangled and 8 year old Niina was injured.  Niina retreated to her mother, 41 year old Yasuko.  Mikio heard the disturbance and went to Rei's room to discover what happened. The intruder used a knife to murder 44 year old Mikio so brutally that the knife broke, and then attacked Niina and Yasuko again using a Santoku knife from the kitchen. 

Once all four family members were dead, the killer stayed in the home for some hours (between 2 to 10).  They used the family computer, ate food, used the bathroom, used first aid kits on his injuries, and took a nap.  Later analysis of the computer showed that after the murders, at 1:18 am and 10:00 am, the computer had been used to connect to the internet. Based off this information, investigators know the killer stayed in the home until at least 1:18 am, but potentially until 10:00 am (though this instance could have been triggered by Yasuko's mother coming over to the home after all her calls to the house had gone unanswered).  Oddly enough, the killer attempted to purchase theater tickets on the computer.

This case is highly unusual in that the killer left behind so much evidence, but has yet to have been found.  The killer's feces were found in an unflushed toilet.  The killer left behind clothing items (in particular a sweater bought in the Kanagawa prefecture that had only sold 130 of its kind).  Trace amounts of sand in a bag left behind by the killer was traced to the Nevada desert near Edwards Air Force Base in California, USA.  DNA and fingerprints for the killer were found in the home, but so far have not been connected to any known person (so they potentially do not have a criminal record). The killer's blood was also discovered (type A, which no member of the Miyazawa family had that type).  The killer is thus known to be male and potentially mixed race.  Furthermore, the police estimate that the killer was born between 1965-1985, 170 cm tall, and thin, based on the physicality one would need to enter the home as the killer did.  Based off the wounds, he is likely right handed.

The case remains active but still with no real leads even 20 years later."

Police, family, and the community could find no trace of his whereabouts despite ongoing searches and police work for years.  Steven was actually alive the whole time and had been kidnapped by a child sex predator, Kenneth Parnell, who had previous run-ins with the law over child sex abuse. Parnell claimed he wanted a boy to raise as his own and have his own family, but he was sexually abusing Steven on a near daily basis when he was small (less often as he his his teen years).  When Steven hit puberty, he was no longer to Parnell's taste and so Parnell went in search for another little boy to kidnap.  He successfully kidnapped 5 year old Timmy White from Ukiah, CA.  Steven did not want Timmy to experience what he had experienced, so he started to plan a way to get TImmy back to his family.  A few weeks after Timmy's kidnapping, Steven managed it - he managed to get them to the police department while Parnell was at his night shift job.  By this point, Steven had lost some memory of who he was originally due to Parnell threatening him over it, but knew his first name and (maybe) his last name. He was able to piece together the story for police.  

Police and legal team at the time did not take the sexual abuse of Steven seriously, in part due to the length of time since he was originally taken and in part due to a culture of not taking child sex crimes seriously. Steven's mormon parents also refuse to acknowledge his sexual abuse and refused to get him therapy or any sort of help for it.  He was bullied at school for ""being gay"" when he was actually a sexual assault victim. Steven testified at Parnell's trial in 1981, and Parnell was sentenced to five yeas imprisonment (and was paroled after two years). Parnell would go on to try to kidnap another boy later on, which would result in a life imprisonment sentence.  

After the trial, Steven had a hard time adjusting back to normal life and fell into drugs and alcohol, which his strict mormon parents did not approve of.  After he almost OD'd, he decided to quit drugs and alcohol altogether. He married his wife in 1985 and had two children with her.  In 1989, he died when a (probably drunk) driver hit his motorcycle.  

Timmy White went on to lead a happy (but short) life. He became a deputy of the LA sheriff's department and gave talks and lectures about his experience as a kidnap victim.  He died in 2010 from a pulmonary embolism."

He stated that one of the employees - a young, slim girl - had stolen from a customer and she would have to be searched.  The Assistant Manager at the time, Donna Summers, identified this thief as 18 year old part time worker, Louise Ogborn.  She was placed into the McDonald's office. Since Donna was too busy to watch over Louise or follow the instructions of the ""officer' herself, she brought her fiance (Walter Nix) to conduct the interview and watch over Louise on the ""officer's"" behalf.  Over the next ~3 hours, this supposed police officer gave instructions under the guise of interviewing and investigating this thievery.  Louise was stripped naked, with only a very small apron to partly cover her body.  Her body was described to the officer over the phone.  Her bodily cavities were 'searched' for the stolen items. She was sexually assaulted by Nix, all at the behest of this police officer.  Each time Summers would come to the office, Louise would beg to be let go, but Summers refused.  After assaulting Louise, Nix left and Summers had to find a replacement to watch over Louise.  She asked Thomas Simms, the maintenance man, to watch over Louise.  The officer tried to get Simms to continue with Louise's ""interogation"" / assault, but Simms knew this situation wasn't quite right.  He refused to go along with the demands and informed Summers of the disgusting demands the cop had made.  Only then did Summers suspect that perhaps this cop wasn't really a cop.  Louise was let go and real police brought in to investigate.  Louise's full assault was caught on the CCTV of the office.

This was just the latest in a series of scams that had been occurring at various fast food restaurants since the early 1990s.  Investigators of another similar scam had been able to connect the phone caller with a pre-paid phone card.  Comparing the footage between different scam events (and stores where the cards had been bought) led officers to 36 year old David Stewart, a married police-wanna-be with five children.  They got a warrant to search his home where they found another pre paid phone card that was linked to several of these fast food scams (but not the one in Mount Washington).  

Stewart was put on trial, but ultimately was found not guilty since the one phone card found at his residence wasn't the one directly used in the Mount Washington situation.  However, from the moment Stewart was arrested for the crimes, there has not been any other such scam perpetuated.

Louise also sued McDonald's for their role in the event.  The scam had been a well known issue, but McDonald's did nothing to inform or train their employees of it or how to respond to it.  McDonald's legal team went so far as to argue that Louise's assault was her own fault and she had ""grown stronger"" by experiencing it.  McDonald's ultimately was found responsible and Louise was  awarded a settlement over $6 million dollars.  McDonalds would go on to appeal and eventually would settle out of court with Louise for an undisclosed amount."

Over the next several years, police did not know who was responsible for this attack, so they focused all their attentions on Lawrence's younger brother, Dennis, who was 12 at the time.  Basing their entire case off the fact that Dennis and Lawrence had argued about curfew, they made Dennis their sole suspect and even went so far as to fake evidence trying to incriminate Dennis.   Ultimately, the police only stopped pursuing Dennis because Brian Beattie confessed to the crime when he was brought in on unrelated charges.  Pedophile Brian Beattie had a long history of sexual assault against boys and men.  He had been arrested several times prior to the attack on Lawrence Haggart.

America's most prolific unsolved serial rapist / killer went on a killing spree from October 1, 1979 to July 27, 1981 before taking a 5 year break.  Last known murder occurred on May 4, 1986.  Earlier suspected murders include Brian and Katie Maggiore (1978) and Claude Snelling (1975). He escalated over time - from burglaries, to rapes, to murders that grew in level of violence and went from 1 female victim to couples.  The attacker was noted to be athletic, whose knowledge of the home and victim suggested he had stalked the victim for some time prior to attacking.  Police suggested a connection to the navy due to the complex diamond knots the attacker used to control the victims.  

By April 25, 2018, a tested DNA sample on Joseph James Deangelo, confirmed a match with the EAR/ONS.  He is in custody and currently awaiting trial.  Deangelo worked for a time as a police officer and had three daughters in the early 1980s.  

As of Jul 2018, it is known that Deangelo's DNA was swabbed from the handle of his car door and discarded trash and tissue. A relative of Deangelo had submitted dna to a genealogy website.  Multiple samples were gathered to confirm for sure that the DNA was Deangelo's and the DNA matched the EAR. 

As of Aug 2018, survivors and family members of victims of EAR/ONS attended court to see Deangelo themselves.  Prosecutors are also looking to review another case - a man called William Evans was found guilty of murdering a woman in 1979, but supporters are saying that his guilty plea was suspicious and there are similarities between this crime and EAR/ONS murders.  A male victim (Hayes) of EAR/ONS spoke out about his experience.  He and his girlfriend at the time were attacked by EAR/ONS.  It's possible that Deangelo also was still prowling neighborhoods up to the time he was arrested.

As of Sep 2018, Deangelo was charged with Snelling's murder. Prosecutors are finding ways to charge Deangelo with the rapes, too (since rape has a statute of limitations) by instead charging him with other things like kidnapping.  Deangelo may need to pay for his own prosecutor if he isn't eligible for one from the state. 

In Oct 2019, some further information was given regarding Dr. Rey Venter and the genelogical techniques they used to build the DNA profile of EARONS and connect him to Deangelo. This is helped lead them to GED match website

As of Nov 2018, there is another possible case that can be linked to Deangelo.  34 year old mom Patricia Newfield was bludgeoned in Nov 1978.  She lived only 6 blocks from Deangelo's brother.  There were no signs of forced entry.  Another possible connection is a murdered woman named Joan ______ in 1979.   These cases have not been established as Deangelo's, but there are some similarities and police are looking into it.  

As of Nov 2018, a pre-trial hearing was set for December 6.  

As of Dec 2018, the judge determined that Deangelo cannot afford his own attorney given that the trial is expected to cost around 20 million dollars.  The trial could take as long as 10 years due to the complexity of the case.  The judge does not see the need to put a media ban on the trial.  

These crimes primarily occurred in the Sacramento and Contra Costa counties."

Over the next seven years, Cindy would report nearly 100 of such incidents to police.  Each time, there was zero evidence of anyone else there.  When abducted or injured, Cindy would always be tied up with a nylon stocking around her throat and usually injected with some sort of drug.  Despite this, there was never any evidence found that supported the presence of another person who could have committed the abductions / assaults.  Cindy would claims that 2 or more men had committed these events, but she would always refuse to elaborate further or claim amnesia.  For certain events, such as a time where a small fire was set in Cindy's basement and investigators concluded it was highly unlikely that anyone outside of the house set the fire due to the items involved in the fire and the fact that there was no sign of any break in.  In 1989, Cindy disappeared (again).  This time, instead of being found alive and not harmed in any permanent way, Cindy's body was found a couple of weeks after her initial disappearance.  She had died of a drug overdose and was found in the same position she always was - tied up with a nylon stocking around her throat.  Police were convinced that Cindy staged the scene and committed suicide (accidentally or otherwise), while Cindy's family believes she was murdered and her stalkers were real people.  Her ex husband, Roy, felt Cindy was suffering from some sort of severe personality disorder, such as a split personality, caused by sexual and physical trauma she endured as a child. Ultimately, a coroner found that Cindy died of an ""unknown event"".  A jury also concluded that the death was an ""unknown event"" by only a 1 vote majority (the rest beleived she had committed suicide).    "

He was last seen by a motorist after he nearly fell in front of the vehicle.  Ten months later on November 19, 1974, 32 year old Geirfinnur Einarsson (unrelated to Guðmundur) received a phone call at his home, drove to a nearby harbour cafe in Keflavik, and then disappeared; his car keys were left in the ignition.  Neither body has ever been found and it is not clear if foul play was involved.  The cases appear to be unrelated. 

Despite a near complete lack of evidence, six suspects were eventually rounded up: 
Sævar Ciesielski, Kristján Viðar Viðarsson, Tryggvi Rúnar Leifsson, Albert Klahn Skaftason, Guðjón Skarphéðinsson and Erla Bolladóttir. 

These six eventually signed confessions to the murders after intense investigative pressure: they had been kept in isolation, interviewed at length with no contact with their lawyers, given drugs, subjected to sleep deprivation and water torture.  The six signed confessions in order to put an end to their solitary confinement, though none of the six had any memories of the victims or their disappearances.  The confinement was a significant amount of time, too: Erla's was for 242 days, while Tryggvi's was for 655 days.   Sævar was kept in custody for 1,533 days.  

Sævar Marinó, Kristján Viðar and Tryggvi Rúnar were convicted of killing  Guðmundur and Albert Klahn was convicted of helping hide the body. 

 Sævar Marinó, Kristján Viðar and Guðjón were convicted of killing Geirfinnur while Erla was convicted of perjury.  

The investigation was heavily criticized after the supreme court ruled that the case could not be re-heared in 1998.  In 2017, the Interior Ministry's Rehearing Committee concluded that the cases of 5 of the 6 defendents should be reheard (Erla's perjury case was left alone).  Following that in September 2018, all five men were acquitted of the crimes.  

To this day, it is not known who may have had a hand in the disappearance of Guðmundur and Geirfinnur. It isn't known if those men even died during that time.  "

Initially, it was believed that Charlie was the perpetrator, who was enacting revenge on the Caffey family for breaking up his relationship.  But once police went looking for him, he was found with Erin (who was unharmed) and with items covered in blood.

When police arrived at the bank to asses the situation, the robbers took bank employees hostage and made some demands (money, a car to get away).  

The hostage situation became a media circus as reporters realized they could call into the bank and chat with the robbers.  This greatly impeded the police's already scattered response to the situation.  Over the next two days, the robbers went on the run with hostages.  Initially, their hostages were the bank employees, but once they had the car they had demanded, they also took hostages from a local bus.  

The police were unable to effectively deal with the situation (and indeed, didn't seem to have a very strong grasp of how to handle the situation).  The non stop interference from the media, which was constantly surrounding the robbers and hostages (and even encouraging the robbers to take interviews and pose with guns aimed at the hostages), greatly impacted the outcome of this event.  

At one point, the police captured the girlfriend of one of the robbers, which resulted in the robber shooting one of the captives - a 14 year old boy, Emanuele, who was protecting his younger sister (also a captive).  The media dragged the boy's body around, which may have impacted this life or death situation.  Medical care was not immediately brought for the boy.  

After another day or so, the police finally decided to spring into action and ram the robber's car and engaged in a gunfight.  Another hostage, Silke, was fatally shot by one of the robbers in this exchange.  

At trial, the robbers were both pronounced guilty and received life sentences.  This case has become internationally known for the media interference in an active police case."

This man had them drive around and gave them orders for several hours until finally taking them to Deadman's Hill, where he shot Michael dead.  He raped Valerie, shot her, and left her for dead.  Though severely injured and permanently disabled, Valerie survived and was able to give testimony regarding the incident including a description of the man's face, which she briefly saw when a car passed by with lights that lit up the man's face. 

Pretty quickly, police zeroed in on James Hanratty, a 25 year old man with a long criminal record of break-ins and car thefts.  Hanratty was recognized by some friends as looking very similar to the police sketches of the perpetrator.  Additionally, he initially lied about his alibi, was found to be in several locations that the perpetrator was said to have been (including a hotel where boxes of bullets were found and the bus where the gun and a bloody cloth was hidden) by witnesses. When pulled into a police lineup, Valerie identified Hanratty as the perpetrator.  

At trial in 1962, Hanratty pronounced his innocence but was found guilty and sentenced to death. He lost his appeal and finally, he was hanged April 4, 1962. 

After the trial concluded, there was a growing movement of support for Hanratty.  People believed he may have been wrongfully convicted.  Even celebrity figures such as John Lennon and Yoko Ono expressed support for Hanratty and his family.  Another figure - Peter Alphon - claimed that Hanratty was innocent and Alphon had been paid to 'end the affair' between Michael and Valerie.  When Alphon was pulled into a police lineup, Valerie did not recognize him.  

As DNA testing became more advanced, DNA evidence from Valerie's clothing worn on the night of the attack was able to be tested to find the true perpetrator.  Alphon was found to not be a match, but Hanratty's test came back prett conclusively - the perpetrator's DNA was two and a half million times more likely to belong to Hanratty than any one else.  Hanratty's family and remaining supporters do not believe the DNA evidence and think it could have been contaminated over the 40+ years of storage."

Her body was found a few weeks later. She had been stabbed, beaten, and assaulted.  Initially, police hyper focused on Rocio's mother's former girlfriend, Dolores Vazquez, despite there being no evidence that Dolores was involved.  In 2001, popular pressure and a media circus ensured that a jury convicted Dolores of murdering Rocio.  This conviction has become known as a massive miscarriage of justice in Spain, with many blaming prejudices towards Dolores' sexuality and a narrative that she was a domineering, predatory lesbian. Dolores' conviction was overturned three months later and a new trial was ordered.  However, all charges were dropped against Dolores when DNA evidence from the crime scene linked Rocio's death to a different person entirely. 

In August 2003, Sonia Carabantes disappeared under similar circumstances to Rocio's. DNA at this crime scene was matched to DNA found at Rocio's crime scene.  A woman came forward to police stating that she had suspicions that her husband was involved in the crime, so his DNA was tested against that which was found at both crime scenes; the DNA matched both crime scenes.  Tony Alexander King was an English immigrant living in Spain with his wife and daughter.  He had a long criminal history going back to his teenage years (involving many sexual assaults and beatings of women) in Britain. 

In 2005, King was sentenced to 36 years in prison for the murder of Sonia Carabantes as well as 7 additional years for an unrelated sexual assault.  In another trial in 2006, he was found guilty of Rocio Wanninkhof's murder and sentenced to an additional 19 years in prison.

The husband, Alan, was found to be a man who already had a criminal record, was in a dire financial state at the time of the murder (and who had received insurance money as well as money he successfully sued from Vicki's family as a result of the murders), and who had been sexually abusing Julie-Anne's younger half sisters for years by this point.

The cold case detectives realized a discrepancy in some of the original testimony given by Gail's brother's then-girlfriend, Pam.  She had been Ryan's alibi the night of the murders, but a lie-detector test at the time had indicated she was lying.  Pam stuck to her story for the next couple of decades, but she finally admitted the truth to the cold case detectives.  Ryan was a controlling and abusive husband who had threatened to kil her if she ever revealed the truth of what happened.  

Ryan had sexually assaulted Gail from the time she was 9 and he was 12.  He openly ogled at her and was jealous when she got married to Rick.  On the night of the murders, he went to their home and shot both of them - to silence Gail about their sexual relationship, according to Pam's testimony. Ryan was a poor perpetrator, though.  Multiple people around the time of the murders noted Ryan's odd behavior and strange things he would say, including ""could I have killed them?"" or openly imagining what the killer would have done upon entering the house or openly discussing how ""hot"" his sister Gail was.

CCTV footage captured her entering the car and that was the last Yingying was seen.  

Police were able to quickly narrow down the perpetrator pool due to the fact that the Saturn Astra was a relatively rare car, with only 18 of this type (four door, black Astra) existing in the county.  Further study of the CCTV footage revealed this car also had a sunroof and a damaged front right hubcap, which further helped narrow down the pool of possible suspects.  Only one of the 18 cars had these exact specifications and it belonged to Brendt Allen Christensen.  

Brendt Allen Christensen was in an open marriage and was an active user of various sexual forums on reddit and fetlife that were of a BDSM, kidnapping, torture variety.  Police interviewed Christensen on June 15, where he admitted to giving an asian woman a ride in his car.  Police let him go, but continued monitoring him, because they believed he would further incriminate himself.  Police approached Christensen's girlfriend and she agreed to wear a wire, thinking that it would exonerate him.  On June 29, Christensen and his girlfriend attended a memorial walk for Yingying.  During this walk, Christensen fully admitted to his girlfriend of his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of Yingying.  He openly bragged about being a serial killer, with Yingying being his 13th victim.  

The following day, the FBI arrested Christensen and he was brought to trial.  On June 24, 2019, he was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.  Yingying's body has not yet been found, since Christensen claimed to have dismembered the body, placed parts in various garbage bags, and the disposed of them in a dumpster.  This dumpster was emptied three days after the body was disposed in it and the contents were taken to a private landfill in Vermillion county, compacted at least twice, and then spread over an area at least 50 yards wide, and then buried under at least 30 feet of garbage.  It would be costly and difficult to try to find the remains in such a place.  Police also did further investigating into Christensen's claim of being a serial killer, but they doubted he had any other victims and have so far found no evidence of other victims."

Derek and Maria Broaddus bought their dream home in New Jersey in 2014 for about $1.35 million (plus $100,000 they put into renovations), but they never moved in.  While renovations were going on at the house, the Broaddus family started receiving threatening letters from ""the watcher"", someone who likely lived in the neighborhood and claimed to be watching the house at all times.  Various letters were sent to the family, all with an angry tone and threats to the family and their children.  Police seemed to have thoroughly investigated the matter, but were unable to identify the sender of the letters. There was a small amount of DNA extracted from one of the letters, which seemed to indicate that the sender was female, but no further identifying information was found.  The watcher claimed that the house was essentially haunted and had been watched by their father and father's father before them.  For fear that their family was in danger, the Broaddus family never moved into the home.  Rumors and news stories about the watcher made the house's value drop sharply and the Broadduses finallly sold it in 2019 for about $960,000."

Her DNA showed up at multiple crimes, but no other evidence of her ever surfaced.  After years of chasing this serial killer theory, it was discovered that some of the cotton swabs used to collect DNA were not approved for such a purpose.  The ""serial killer's"" DNA was really the DNA of a factory worker who processed these cotton swabs.  

With that theory out of the way, police had to reinvestigate many of these murders that they had attributed to the phantom serial killer to find the true killers.  This eventually lead them to uncover the NSU, a white nationalist group primarily consisting of Uwe Bohnhardt, Uwe Mundlos, Beate Zschape, and some male accomplices over the years.  Throughout the 90s, they planned robberies, bombings, and other attacks primarily on the Turkish population in Germany.  Ultimately, the police honed in on Mundlos and Bohnhardt, who committed murder-suicide to not be arrested.  Zschape turned herself in and, in 2018, sentenced to life imprisonment for her numerous crimes - including arson, first degree murder, etc."

They were acquaintances and former coworkers.  Unbeknownst to Christie, Chand harbored extreme thoughts of revenge against Christie because he felt she had abandoned him and been a bad friend when she left her old job and didn't speak to him as much.  He threatened her with a knife and initiated an assault (which he backed down from).  He let her return home.

At that point, Christie and her family got the police involved.  Chand was charged with kidnapping, intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and assault with intent to sexually violate.  Initially, Chand's application for bail was denied for fear that he would attack Christie again.  A second judge, David McNaughton, granted bail on October 5.  In the following weeks, Chand watched Christie and gave her some space, to help lull her into a sense of security.  Then on the early morning of November 7, 2011, Chand went to Christie's house.  Christie's mother answered the door.  As soon as Chand saw Christie, he chased her until he caught up to her and stabbed her to death.  

At trial, Chand was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity.  He has been committed to a psychiatric hospital indefinitely. "

While the case itself is straightforward - the victims were murdered by members of the Potter family and Bill Payne's cousin Jamie Curd - the circumstances around the murder are strange. 

The Potters moved to the area in 2005 and were never very popular with people.  The father, Marvin Potter, claimed to be former military and CIA (neither of which was true) and got into many arguments and fueds with people.  Both Marvin and his wife Barbara were very protective of their daughter Jenelle, who lived off disability and was in special education for most of her life.  Jenelle started a secret relationship with Jamie Curd, who was 8-10 years her senior and who had never had a girlfriend before.  They had to keep their relationship a secret as Marvin and Barbara didn't want Jamie dating Jenelle.  Jenelle primarily lived her life on social media and did't go out too much.  At one point, she was friendly with Billie Jean and Bill, but she became overbearing (to the point of making 15-20+ calls a day) and Jenelle was unfriended by the victims.  Jenelle took this very personally and a feud between the parties started.  Jenelle ultimately made many fake profiles to both harass Billie Jean and Bill Payne as well as to fake-harass Jenelle, and paint  her as the victim of harassment.  Jenelle created a fake persona, ""Chris"", a so-called childhood friend and current CIA agent.  Over the course of a year, Jenelle manipulated Jamie and her parents (via Chris) to put an end to Bill Payne and Billie Jean Hayworth.  On January 31, 2012, Jamie Curd and Marvin Potter murdered Bill and Billie Jean.  

Ultimately, Janelle was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences. Barbara and Marvin are also sentenced to two concurrent life sentences.  Jamie took a plea deal and received 25 years in prison for his part in the crime. "

Kuno Hofmann suffered from the loss of his speech and hearing from a young age.  As a young man, he became interested in satanism, black magic, and ritualistic behaviors involving necrophilia and vampirism.  He seemed to believe that drinking the blood of others may potentially cure his disabilities and improve his looks. In 1971, police and morgue attendants made note of some bizarre grave robberies, which involved bodies that were exhumed and gnawed upon and potential sex acts enacted on the female bodies.  In 1972, desiring a fresher victim, Hofmann shot and killed a young couple and drank their blood.  He was captured only a few days later, when he was caught in the act by a morgue attendant.  Hofmann was ultimately deemed insane and confined to a mental asylum. "
